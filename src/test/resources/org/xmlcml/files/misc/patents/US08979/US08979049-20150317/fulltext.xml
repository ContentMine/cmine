<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, progress has been made in slimming down of display devices such as television sets. The slimming down of display devices has enabled the display devices to be hung on walls by means of mount bracket systems. The mount bracket system is a system which includes a wall-mount part and a wall-mount frame and is configured to hang, e.g., a display device on a wall by securing the wall-mount part on the backside of the display device and by anchoring the wall-mount part to the wall-mount frame mounted on the wall. Many houses and commercial facilities actually have display devices mounted on walls in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1 describes a conventional mount bracket system. The conventional mount bracket system for a display device will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates how a wall-mount part included in the conventional mount bracket system for a display device is secured to a target object. The wall-mount part <b>100</b> includes an axis portion <b>100</b><i>a </i>and a stopper <b>100</b><i>b </i>provided at an end of the axis portion <b>100</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the wall-mount part <b>100</b> is secured to and projects from the target object <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates how the wall-mount part is anchored to a wall-mount frame in the conventional mount bracket system for a display device. The wall-mount frame <b>300</b> includes a path <b>400</b> which is a groove bends at an intermediate point. The wall-mount part <b>100</b> is anchored to the wall-mount frame <b>300</b> by inserting the axis portion <b>100</b><i>a </i>of the wall-mount part into the path <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is described that, in the conventional mount bracket system for a display device, the intermediate point at which the path <b>400</b> bends makes it less likely that the wall-mount part <b>100</b> is moved even by an upward impact.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">PATENT DOCUMENT 1: Japanese Patent Publication No. H11-201386</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in view of the fact that the wall-mount part <b>100</b> has a circular cross section as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, when an upward force is applied to the target object, a collision between the axis portion <b>100</b><i>a </i>of the wall-mount part <b>100</b> and an upper edge portion <b>500</b> of the path <b>400</b> causes a resultant force acting on the axis portion <b>100</b><i>a </i>and having a horizontal component.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, the conventional mount bracket system is disadvantageous in that the target object may be easily moved in a diagonally upward direction by an upward impact.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is therefore an object of the present disclosure to provide a mount bracket system which is capable of anchoring a target object such that the target object is less likely to be moved by an upward impact.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To achieve the object, a mount bracket system of the present disclosure is configured such that a path through which an axis portion of a wall-mount part included in the mount bracket system passes has a projection, and the projection is located nearer an opening of the path than a retaining point for the axis portion is, and projects inward from an edge of the path.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Specifically, the mount bracket system of the present disclosure includes: a wall-mount part including an axis portion with a cylindrical column shape, and a stopper provided at the axis portion and having a width larger than a diameter of the axis portion; and a wall-mount frame including a path continuing from an opening and having a width larger than the diameter of the axis portion and smaller than the width of the stopper, wherein the path includes a projection projecting inward from an edge of the path, and the projection is located nearer the opening than the axis portion of the wall-mount part is when the axis portion is retained at a retaining point of the wall-mount frame.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantages of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the mount bracket system of the present disclosure, even if an upward force is applied to a target object, the projection provided on the edge of the path and located on a side adjacent to the opening controls movements of the wall-mount part. Consequently, it is possible to prevent the target object from becoming detached from the wall-mount frame.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A mount bracket system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">&#x3c;Configuration of Mount Bracket System&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A configuration of the mount bracket system is now described.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">First, the overall configuration of the mount bracket system is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), the mount bracket system <b>20</b> includes a plurality of wall-mount parts <b>2</b> secured to the backside of a target object <b>1</b> and a wall-mount frame <b>3</b> to which the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> are anchored.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each of the constituent components of the mount bracket system <b>20</b> is outlined below. The wall-mount parts <b>2</b> include four wall-mount parts <b>2</b> secured to and projecting from the backside of the target object <b>1</b>. The wall-mount frame <b>3</b> is secured on a wall (not shown). The wall-mount parts <b>2</b> will be detailed later.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The target object <b>1</b> may be any object which is hung on a wall for use or for viewing. A display device such as a plasma display panel is exemplified as the target object <b>1</b> in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), how the target object <b>1</b> is anchored to the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> is described next. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), each of the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> disposed in an associated one of grooves formed in the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> in a state where the target object <b>1</b> is anchored by means of the mount bracket system <b>20</b>. In this manner, the target object <b>1</b> is anchored to the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> through the plurality of wall-mount parts <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The wall-mount parts <b>2</b> are described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>), each of the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> includes an axis portion <b>4</b>, a stopper <b>5</b>, and a screw portion <b>6</b>. The axis portion <b>4</b> is a resin molding and has a cylindrical column shape. The stopper <b>5</b> is a resin molding and has a substantially cylindrical column shape. In this embodiment, the axis portion <b>4</b> and the stopper <b>5</b> are molded in one piece using a resin material.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>), the stopper <b>5</b> has a width larger than the diameter of the axis portion <b>4</b>. When the stopper <b>5</b> has a substantially cylindrical column shape as in this embodiment, the width of stopper <b>5</b> refers to the diameter of the column shape. The stopper <b>5</b> may have a shape other than the cylindrical column shape, and it is sufficient, in such a case, that the stopper <b>5</b> has a width larger than the diameter of the axis portion <b>4</b>. This configuration is necessary to prevent the wall-mount portion <b>2</b> having the axis portion <b>4</b> inserted into the groove (which will be detailed later) formed in the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> from becoming detached from the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>. The screw portion <b>6</b> is made of, e.g., a metal rod, and is bonded such that the longitudinal axis of the screw portion <b>6</b> is coincident with the axial direction of the axis portion <b>4</b> and the stopper <b>5</b>. The screw portion <b>6</b> has a thread groove formed thereon. The screw portion <b>6</b> is used to secure the axis portion <b>4</b> and stopper <b>5</b> to the target object <b>1</b>. The backside of the target object <b>1</b> has threaded holes each corresponding to the screw portion <b>6</b>. Each of the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> is secured to the target object <b>1</b> by screwing the screw portion <b>6</b> into an associated one of the threaded holes of the target object <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The method for anchoring the target object <b>1</b> to the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> through the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> is described next.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates, with a line of operational flow, how the target object <b>1</b> is anchored to the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> through the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> by using the mount bracket system of this embodiment. Specifically, the right half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a cross section of a lateral side of the target object <b>1</b> to which the wall-mount part <b>2</b> is secured, and the left half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>, as viewed from front, having a path <b>7</b> which is one of the grooves formed in the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The path <b>7</b> is formed by cutting out a part of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> by means of, e.g., pressing. The path <b>7</b> has a width which is larger than the diameter of the axis portion <b>4</b> and smaller than the width of the stopper <b>5</b>. The wall-mount frame <b>3</b> has a convex shape having therein a hollow space having a depth, and accordingly, the path <b>7</b> adjoins to the hollow space having the depth. This configuration enables the axis portion <b>4</b> to be inserted in the path <b>7</b>. As indicated by the arrow (the line of operational flow) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the axis portion <b>4</b> of the wall-mount part <b>2</b> is caused to pass through the path <b>7</b> of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>. The path <b>7</b> has a lower end which retains the axis portion <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although the path <b>7</b> of this embodiment has the lower end which is closed, the path <b>7</b> may have a narrowing width leading to a lower end having a width smaller than the diameter of the axis portion <b>4</b> such that the lower end retains the axis portion <b>4</b>. In sum, the path <b>7</b> is required to have a portion where the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained without moving further in the vertical direction (i.e. in the downward direction). Any portion of the path <b>7</b> which satisfies this requirement and retains the axis portion <b>4</b> is referred to as the lower end of the path <b>7</b>. In this manner, the target object <b>1</b> is anchored to the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> through the wall-mount parts <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a cross section of a lateral side of the target object <b>1</b> anchored by means of the mount bracket system <b>20</b> according to this embodiment. Each of the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> is secured to the target object <b>1</b> through the screw portion <b>6</b>. The axis portion <b>4</b> of each of the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> is supported in the path <b>7</b> at the lower end which serves as a retaining point, resulting in that the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> are anchored to the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>. Thus, the target object <b>1</b> is anchored to the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> through the wall-mount parts <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is presumed that an operator anchors the target object <b>1</b> to a wall in the following manner. First, the operator secures the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> to a desired portion of the wall. Next, the operator screws the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> into the target object <b>1</b>. The operator, then, lifts up the target object <b>1</b> and fits the axis portions <b>4</b> of the wall-mount parts <b>2</b> into the paths <b>7</b> of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> in a simultaneous manner.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Upon inserting the axis portions <b>4</b> into the paths <b>7</b>, the weight of the target object <b>1</b> causes the axis portions <b>4</b> to move to the lower ends of the paths <b>7</b>. This is because each of the paths <b>7</b> includes a vertical path and a path extending in a diagonally downward direction continuously from the vertical path. Here, the path extending in a diagonally downward direction refers to at least part of the path <b>7</b> obliquely intersects the vertical direction when the system is in use.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">&#x3c;Shape, Functions, and Advantages of Path&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The shape of each of the paths <b>7</b> formed in the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> used in the mount bracket system of this embodiment will be described below in detail, together with the functions and advantages of the paths.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, the shape of the paths <b>7</b> formed in the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> is described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged view of one of the paths <b>7</b> which are the grooves formed in the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> used in the mount bracket system of this embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the path <b>7</b> has an opening <b>7</b><i>a </i>which opens upwardly in the vertical direction of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>. From the opening <b>7</b><i>a</i>, the path <b>7</b> decreases in width downwardly in a gradual manner to have its width substantially equal to a width W<b>1</b>. The width W<b>1</b> is larger than the diameter of the axis portion <b>4</b>. The path <b>7</b> extends in the vertical direction, and then bends in a diagonally downward direction from a bend portion. Part of the edge of the path <b>7</b> which is located close to the bend portion is cut out such that the width of the path <b>7</b> increases from the width W<b>1</b> to a width W<b>2</b>, inwardly with respect to the bend portion. Consequently, the path <b>7</b> has a projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>formed at the point from which the path <b>7</b> increases in width from the width W<b>1</b> to the width W<b>2</b> that is larger than width W<b>1</b>. Thus, the projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>projects from the upper edge of the path <b>7</b> toward the inside of the path <b>7</b>. The projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>is provided to control upward movements of the axis portion <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As descried above, upon insertion of the wall-mount part <b>2</b> into the opening <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the path <b>7</b> of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>, the axis portion <b>4</b> of the wall-mount part <b>2</b> is moved by gravity and reaches the lower end of the path <b>7</b>, where the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained. When the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained, the projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>formed in the path <b>7</b> is located at an upper point of the path <b>7</b> relative to the vertical line passing through the center point of the axis portion <b>4</b>. Here, the upper point of the path <b>7</b> refers to a point which is nearer the opening <b>7</b><i>a </i>than the axis portion <b>4</b> which is retained at the lower end of the path <b>7</b> is.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Here, it is appropriate to form the projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>such that the projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>comes into collision with a surface portion of the axis portion <b>4</b> corresponding to the fourth quadrant of the four quadrants divided by the vertical and horizontal lines passing through the center point of the axis portion <b>4</b>, in other words, with a surface portion of the axis portion <b>4</b> opposite to the opening <b>7</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The projection <b>7</b><i>b</i>, which is formed by cutting out part of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>, and the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> are made of the same material. This configuration in which the projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>and the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> are made of the same material is advantageous in both of the strength of the projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>and machining costs.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The advantages obtained from the shape of the paths <b>7</b> formed in the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> will be described next.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When a force acting in a vertically upward direction (in the direction indicated by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is applied to the axis portion <b>4</b> which is in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the axis portion <b>4</b> of the wall-mount part <b>2</b> moves along the edge of the path <b>7</b> located upward in a vertically direction (hereinafter may be referred to simply as &#x201c;located upward&#x201d;). This is because a collision between an upper edge of the path <b>7</b> and the axis portion <b>4</b> generates a resultant force acting toward the opening <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the path <b>7</b> (hereinafter may be referred to simply as &#x201c;toward upper left&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>), how the axis portion <b>4</b> moves is described. Here, the axis portion <b>4</b> moves from the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>). In each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>), the arrow extending from the center point of the axis portion <b>4</b> indicates the direction of an applied force.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), first, the axis portion <b>4</b> moves upward, that is, the axis portion <b>4</b> performs a movement which causes the wall-mount part <b>2</b> to become detached from the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this embodiment, however, an upper left portion of the axis portion <b>4</b> comes into collision with the projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>) when the axis portion <b>4</b> continues to move. The reason for the collision between the upper left portion of the axis portion <b>4</b> and the projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>is that the projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>is located at the upper point of the path <b>7</b> relative to the vertical line passing through the center point of the axis portion <b>4</b> (i.e., located nearer the opening <b>7</b><i>a </i>than the vertical line is). Accordingly, the collision generates a repulsive force acting toward lower right (a force acting opposite to the opening <b>7</b><i>a</i>). The axis portion <b>4</b> of the wall-mount part <b>2</b> is consequently moved to the point where the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained in the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> again. As a result, even if a force acting in the vertically upward direction is applied to the axis portion <b>4</b>, the wall-mount part <b>2</b> does not become detached from the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>. That is, even if a force acting in the vertically upward direction is applied to the target object <b>1</b>, the target object <b>1</b> does not become detached from the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">&#x3c;First Variation&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A first variation of this embodiment will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an enlarged view of one of paths <b>9</b> formed in a wall-mount frame <b>3</b> used in a mount bracket system according to the first variation. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the path <b>9</b> has an opening <b>9</b><i>a </i>which opens upwardly in the vertical direction of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>. From the opening <b>9</b><i>a</i>, the path <b>9</b> decreases in width downwardly in a gradual manner to have its width substantially equal to a width W<b>1</b>. The width W<b>1</b> is larger than the diameter of the axis portion <b>4</b>. The path <b>9</b> extends in the vertical direction, and then bends in a diagonally downward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the path <b>9</b> of the this variation, the lower end which is the retaining point for the axis portion <b>4</b> has an upper edge which is cut out such that the width of the path <b>9</b> increases from the width W<b>1</b> to a width W<b>2</b>. Consequently, a projection <b>9</b><i>b </i>is formed at the point where the width of the path <b>9</b> increases from the width W<b>1</b> to the width W<b>2</b> that is larger than the width W<b>1</b>. Thus, the projection <b>9</b><i>b </i>projects from the upper edge of the path <b>9</b> toward the inside of the path <b>9</b>. The projection <b>9</b><i>b </i>is provided for controlling upward movements of the axis portion <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, upon insertion of the wall-mount part <b>2</b> into the opening <b>9</b><i>a </i>of the path <b>9</b> of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>, the axis portion <b>4</b> of the wall-mount part <b>2</b> is moved by gravity and reaches the lower end of the path <b>9</b>, where the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained. When the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained, the projection <b>9</b><i>b </i>formed in the path <b>9</b> is located at an upper point of the path <b>9</b> relative to the vertical line passing through the center point of the axis portion <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The projection <b>9</b><i>b</i>, which is formed by cutting out the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>, and the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> are made of the same material.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A difference between the path <b>9</b> and the path <b>7</b> is described next.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The path <b>7</b> and path <b>9</b> each of which is formed in the corresponding wall-mount frame <b>3</b> share a commonality: The projections <b>7</b><i>b </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>are each located at the corresponding upper point of the path <b>7</b> or <b>9</b> relative to the vertical line passing through the center point of the axis portion <b>4</b>. On the other hand, the path <b>9</b> of this variation is different from the path <b>7</b> in that the projection <b>9</b><i>b </i>is located above (directly above) the axis portion <b>4</b>. That is, the projection <b>9</b><i>b </i>is closer to the axis portion <b>4</b> than the projection <b>7</b><i>b </i>is.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With this configuration, the axis portion <b>4</b> only slightly moves even if a force having an upward component is applied to the axis portion <b>4</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), when an upward force is applied to the axis portion <b>4</b> retained in the path <b>7</b>, the force and the upper edge of the path <b>7</b> cause a resultant force acting on the axis portion <b>4</b>, and the axis portion <b>4</b> moves along the edge of the path <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">On the other hand, when an upward force is applied to the axis portion <b>4</b> in the path <b>9</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the projection <b>9</b><i>b </i>located directly above the axis portion <b>4</b> causes a resultant forcer to act in the downward direction as indicated by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Thus, the axis portion <b>4</b> is less likely to move upward along the edge of the path <b>9</b>. As a result, this variation has an advantage that the target object <b>1</b> scarcely rattles even if an upward force is applied to the target object <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">&#x3c;Second Variation&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A second variation of this embodiment will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an enlarged view of one of paths <b>10</b> formed in a wall-mount frame <b>3</b> used in a mount bracket system according to the second variation. As illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the path <b>10</b> has an opening <b>10</b><i>a </i>which opens upwardly in the vertical direction of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>. From the opening <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the path <b>10</b> decreases in width downwardly in a gradual manner to have its width substantially equal to a width W<b>1</b>. The width W<b>1</b> is larger than the diameter of the axis portion <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The path <b>10</b> of this variation extends parallel to the vertical direction. Further, the lower end of the path <b>10</b> serving as the retaining point for the axis portion <b>4</b> is formed such that the distance between both lateral sides of the lower end is equal to a width W<b>2</b>. More specifically, the lower end of the path <b>10</b> is formed by cutting out the edge in such a manner that the width of the path <b>10</b> increases from the width W<b>1</b> to the width W<b>2</b> through projections <b>10</b><i>b </i>defining a width W<b>3</b> which is smaller than the width W<b>1</b>. The width W<b>3</b> is larger than the diameter of the axis portion <b>4</b>. Thus, the two projections <b>10</b><i>b </i>each project toward the inside of the path <b>10</b> from the edge above the retaining point where the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained. Accordingly, the projections <b>10</b><i>b </i>can control upward movements of the axis portion <b>4</b>. Although it is not necessarily required to provide the projections <b>10</b><i>b </i>at two points, the projections <b>10</b><i>b </i>provided at two points are more preferable than one projection <b>10</b><i>b </i>provided at a single point.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, upon insertion of the wall-mount part <b>2</b> into the opening <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the path <b>10</b> of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>, the axis portion <b>4</b> of the wall-mount part <b>2</b> is moved by gravity and reaches the lower end of the path <b>10</b>, where the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The projections <b>10</b><i>b</i>, which are formed by cutting out the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>, and the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> are made of the same material.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">With this configuration, in most cases, an upper left portion or un upper right portion of the axis portion <b>4</b> comes into collision with the projections <b>10</b><i>b </i>even if a force having an upward component is applied to the axis portion <b>4</b>. The reason for the collision between the axis portion <b>4</b> and the projections <b>10</b><i>b </i>is that the projections <b>10</b><i>b </i>are located above the axis portion <b>4</b> retained at the lower end of the path <b>10</b> and the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained between the cutout portions which defining the width W<b>2</b> that is larger than the with W<b>3</b>. Although the path <b>10</b> extends in the vertical direction, since the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained at the lower end whose both sides define the width W<b>2</b> larger than the width W<b>3</b>, it is extremely rare a force is applied in such a manner that all of the axis portions <b>4</b> provided at four points move upward without coming into collision with both projections <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the paths <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the axis portion <b>4</b> comes into collision with the projections <b>10</b><i>b</i>, a repulsive force acting downwardly (acting opposite to the opening <b>10</b><i>a</i>) is generated, as described above. The axis portion <b>4</b> of the wall-mount part <b>2</b> is consequently moved to the point where the axis portion <b>4</b> is retained in the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> again. As a result, even if force acting in the vertically upward direction is applied to the axis portion <b>4</b>, the wall-mount part <b>2</b> does not become detached from the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Summary of Embodiment and Variations</heading>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to this embodiment and the variations thereof, even if an upward force is applied to the target object <b>1</b>, the configuration of the wall-mount frame <b>3</b> controls the movement of the wall-mount parts <b>2</b>. As a result, it is possible to prevent the target object <b>1</b> from becoming detached from the wall-mount frame <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Any article such as various electrical products, heavy objects, and exhibits may be selected as the target object <b>1</b>. The plasma display panel has been described above as an example. For example, a liquid crystal display panel, a clock, or a painting may be selected as the target object.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">However, the present disclosure is particularly useful when a display device is selected as the target object as in this embodiment. Since the present disclosure is resistant to upward impacts applied from below the target object, the present disclosure is useful for installing the target object within arm's reach of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Since the present disclosure allows a target object to move in a specific direction other than the vertical direction, the present disclosure is useful for hanging a target object in a detachable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The stability of the present disclosure increases in proportion to the weight of a target object when the target object is stationary. Therefore, the present disclosure is effective for a heavy object.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In view of the above three advantages of the present disclosure, it is preferable to adopt a display device as the target object.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The mount bracket system of the present disclosure is useful as a system for anchoring a wall-hang heavy object such as a display device to a wall.</p>
