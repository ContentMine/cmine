      <p>A closure component for solids-handling equipment includes a closure body configured
         to close a solids flow path by displacement of the closure body along a stroke axis
         and a removable metallic sealing element attached to the closure body. The metallic
         sealing element is configured sealingly to engage an endless metallic seat spaced
         radially outwardly from the stroke axis when the closure body closes the solids flow
         path. The closure body includes or defines at least one locating formation to engage
         and locate the metallic sealing element. The least one locating formation is positioned
         radially outwardly from the stroke axis and more radially outwardly from the stroke
         axis than at least a portion of the metallic sealing element so that at least a portion
         of the metallic sealing element is positioned between the locating formation and the
         stroke axis, thereby correctly to locate the metallic sealing element in position
         relative to the closure body or relative to the stroke axis during fitting of the
         metallic sealing element to the closure body.

         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national phase application of International Application No.
            PCT/IB2012/052255, filed May 7, 2012, designating the United States and claiming priority
            to Great Britain Patent Application No. 1109131.1, filed May 27, 2011, both of which
            are incorporated by reference as if fully rewritten herein.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">THIS INVENTION relates to solids-handling equipment. In particular, the invention
            relates to a closure component for solids-handling equipment, and to a solids-handling
            closure assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">For some solids-handling equipment, such as a Sasol-Lurgi (trade name) or a Sasol®
            FBDB (trade name) gasifier, it is necessary intermittently or continuously to load
            and unload particulate material, such as particulate carbonaceous material (e.g. coal)
            and ash. Thus, for example, in the case of a pressurised gasifier (e.g. a fixed bed
            dry bottom gasifier), particulate carbonaceous feedstock is loaded into the gasifier,
            and gasified at elevated temperatures and pressures, and after gasification any remaining
            ungasified material is removed from the gasifier as ash and passed into a pressurized
            ash lock. The ash lock is then sealed off from the gasifier, depressurized and the
            ash removed. To ensure the continuing operation of the pressurised gasifier during
            the depressurizing of the ash lock, it is important that a pressure seal is maintained
            between the pressurised gasifier and the ash lock. Similar arrangements may also be
            used in other pressurised solids-handling equipment.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the current state of the art, a pressure seal between the pressurised gasifier
            and the ash lock is achieved with a valve assembly or solids-handling closure assembly
            comprising of two primary sub-assemblies or assembled components, namely a closure
            component (typically a conical valve closure body or cone) for closing off a solids
            flow path, and a separate seat component defining a metallic seat for the closure
            component. The seat component typically remains stationery while the closure component
            is hydraulically actuated (typically up and down in a vertical plane) between open
            and closed conditions, along a common centre line of the closure component and the
            seat component. Apart from providing a metal-to-metal pressure seal when in the closed
            condition when a differential pressure is present across the valve assembly, the valve
            assembly also serves to control material flow through the valve assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the prior art, the closure component typically includes a closure body in the form
            of a circular disk-shaped forging with a conical capped section of a diameter larger
            than a seat bore, connected to a tie rod which serves as a linkage to a hydraulic
            actuation system. Due to the severe process conditions (an operating pressure of up
            to about 100 bar(g) and an operating temperature up to 600° C.) and abrasiveness of
            the ash flowing through the valve assembly, a sealing element in the form of a separate
            tungsten carbide ring is provided on an outer periphery of the closure body, the ring
            interfacing with a similar tungsten carbide ring of the seat component to create metal
            seal surfaces. When the closure component is actuated from an open condition to a
            closed condition, a pressure seal is thus created by metal-to-metal contact between
            the surfaces of the tungsten carbide rings of the closure component and the seat component
            respectively.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the prior art valve assembly, occasions arise where the pressure seal cannot
            be maintained due to gas leakage through the valve assembly. In extreme cases, this
            results in shutdown of the equipment (e.g. a gasifier), which is clearly undesirable
            as it may severely impact on production levels and income generated from the equipment.
            The prior art design thus results in inefficient operation and reduction or mitigation
            of this inefficiency would be beneficial.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Investigations have revealed that leakage through the valve assembly is partly due
            to problems associated with the design of the closure component and not the seat component.
            Brittle fracture of the tungsten carbide ring of the closure component occurs as a
            result of stress induced in the ring, which in turn is caused by differential thermal
            expansion of the closure body and the tungsten carbide ring. The ring grows at a lesser
            rate than the closure body due to disparate material properties. Stress is also induced
            in the tungsten carbide ring of the closure component due to deflection of the tungsten
            carbide ring of the closure component on impact with the tungsten carbide ring of
            the seat component, in many cases due to poor retention of the tungsten carbide ring
            of the closure component in a correct position on the closure body. Furthermore, a
            leak path often develops between the closure body and the tungsten carbide ring, most
            likely as a result of said differential thermal expansion and said poor retention

         <p id="p-0011" num="0013">In this specification, the term “component” is thus intended to include an assembled
            component comprising more than one part, such as a closure component comprising at
            least a closure body and a sealing element.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0014">Typically, the closure component is configured to close a flow path which is circular
            in transverse cross section by plugging the flow path.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0015">Advantageously, the presence of one or more locating formations positioned more radially
            outwardly from the stroke axis than a portion or portions of the sealing element allows
            the correct positioning of the sealing element, which is typically annular, concentric
            with the closure body, which is typically circular in plan, at room temperature during
            assembly of the closure component.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0016">Typically, there is no locating formation radially inwardly of the metallic sealing
            element such that radially outward displacement of the locating formation as a result
            of heat expansion of the closure body is inhibited by the presence of the metallic
            sealing element.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0017">As will be appreciated, with a locating formation as described, outward displacement
            of the locating formation from a centre of the closure body, i.e. away from the stroke
            axis, at the operating temperature of the closure component is greater than the outward
            displacement of the portion of the metallic sealing element between the locating formation
            and the stroke axis, when the metallic sealing element expands at a lesser rate than
            the closure body due to disparate material properties. The at least one locating formation
            thus does not interfere with the metallic sealing element during heat expansion and
            does not cause stress on the metallic sealing element during heat expansion. Stress
            induced brittle fracture of the metallic sealing element due to differential expansion
            is therefore inhibited or prevented.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0018">The metallic sealing element may have an outer periphery circumnavigating the stroke
            axis and spaced from the stroke axis, with said at least one locating formation being
            adjacent said outer periphery.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0019">The metallic sealing element may thus have a circular outer periphery, and the at
            least one locating formation may be in the form of an annular locating surface defined
            by the closure body, the locating surface defined by the closure body having a diameter
            marginally greater than that of an annular locating surface of the metallic sealing
            element, at room temperature. The locating surface of the metallic sealing element
            may be defined by the outer periphery of the metallic sealing element.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0020">The metallic sealing element may be annular and the closure body may define an annular
            recess to receive the annular metallic sealing element.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0021">A width of the annular recess taken in a radial direction relative to the stroke axis
            may be greater than a width of the annular metallic sealing element taken in a radial
            direction relative to the stroke axis so that, when the annular metallic sealing element
            is located in the annular recess, the metallic sealing element is abutting against
            a radially outer periphery of the annular recess, whilst the metallic sealing element
            is spaced from a radially inner periphery of the annular recess. Thus, preferably,
            the radially inner periphery of the annular recess is not in contact with the metallic
            sealing element, at least at room temperature, providing an expansion space for the
            closure body at the operating temperature of the closure component.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0022">Typically, the closure body, or at least a portion of the closure body in contact
            with the metallic sealing element, is of graphite-cast iron or ductile iron, and is
            typically in the form of a disc-shaped forged body with a diameter in plan larger
            than the seat for the closure component. This metallic sealing element is typically
            of tungsten carbide and, as indicated hereinbefore, is typically in the form of a
            ring.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0023">The closure component may include a seal between the closure body and the metallic
            sealing element. Typically, the seal circumnavigates or extends around the stroke
            axis. The seal is preferably endless, providing at least one endless seal surface.
            Also typically, the seal is spaced from the stroke axis.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0024">The seal may be located in an annular recess defined in at least one of the closure
            body and the metallic sealing element and located between the closure body and the
            metallic sealing element. Typically, the annular recess is concentric with the stroke
            axis.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0025">The seal may be in the form of a hollow metal ring with one or more openings so that
            an interior volume of the ring is open to the immediate environment of the seal. In
            one embodiment of the invention, the seal is in the form of a metal C-ring.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0026">As will be appreciated, the seal in use typically separates a higher pressure side
            of the closure component from a lower pressure side of the closure component. Said
            one or more openings of the seal may be on the higher pressure side of the closure
            component so that the interior volume of the seal is potentially exposed to the higher
            pressure.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0027">Advantageously, the seal provides an active seal between surfaces of the closure body
            and the metallic sealing element. A hollow seal such as a C-ring has the ability to
            retain its shape both by virtue of material memory and the fact that its inner volume
            is open to the environment, which allows the hollow seal to expand with increasing
            pressure. Constant contact is thus established between the seal and the closure body
            and between the seal and the metallic sealing element. As a result, limited relative
            movement of parts of the closure component, e.g. the closure body and the metallic
            sealing element, can be accommodated, e.g. under impact when the closure component
            slams shut to close the solids flow path. Stress induced in the metallic sealing element
            due to deflection of the metallic sealing element on impact when the closure component
            is seated is accordingly reduced.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0028">The metallic sealing element may be held in place against the closure body by a retaining
            element which bears against the metallic sealing element but which does not pass through
            the metallic sealing element.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0029">The retaining element may be attached to the closure body radially inwardly from the
            metallic sealing element, thus extending radially outwardly over a portion of the
            closure body from where it is attached to the closure body to reach the metallic sealing
            element.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0030">Preferably, the retaining element is spaced from the closure body so that there is
            no direct contact between the retaining element and the closure body. Typically, fasteners
            such as bolts are used to attach the retaining element to the closure body with the
            retaining element being annular and spaced from the closure body where it extends
            or spans over the closure body.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0031">Advantageously, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, only a radially outer
            peripheral portion of the retaining element contacts the metallic sealing element,
            with no contact between the retaining element and the closure body where the retaining
            element is attached to the closure body. This configuration provides a spring effect
            which limits differences in the seating load between the metallic sealing element
            and the closure body at atmospheric temperature on the one hand, and at elevated operating
            temperature for the closure component on the other hand, thereby inhibiting or preventing
            stress induced due to the metallic sealing element deforming or buckling when the
            closure component is seated to close the solids flow path.

            <b>10</b>. In other words, retrofitting of existing closure components to obtain the advantages
            of the invention is thus achieved by means of relatively minor modifications.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0068" num="0073">It must be appreciated that the closure component 
            <b>10</b> and the closure assembly 
            <b>200</b> may find application also in carbonaceous feedstock (e.g. coal) beneficiation or
            upgrading plants, and potentially also in other pressurised equipment or vessels handling
            solids material at elevated temperatures, e.g. combustion apparatus, pyrolysis apparatus,
            fluidised bed gasification apparatus, food processing apparatus and bulk material
            handling equipment for agricultural products or ore beneficiation. For use as a feedstock
            closure mechanism for feeding feedstock into a high pressure environment, the closure
            assembly 
            <b>200</b> is typically inverted so that the closure assembly 
            <b>200</b> is in a closed condition when the closure component 
            <b>10</b> is at an upper end of its stroke. Other geometric changes may also be required (e.g.
            the shape or configuration of the cone-shaped end piece and positioning of sealing
            elements) beyond a simple inversion of the parts. Such required changes would however
            be readily apparent to a person skilled in the art.
