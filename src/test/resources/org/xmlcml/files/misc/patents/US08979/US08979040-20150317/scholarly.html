         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a supporting device and, in particular, to a supporting
            device for an electronic device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accompanying the progressive of technology, various kinds of electronic products have
            been developed for providing better life quality. In order to broaden the applications,
            many varied electronic products become easily portable and operable anytime. These
            electronic products include, for example, smart phones, PDA, handheld game consoles,
            tablet computers, or the likes. They provide a sufficient convenience in our lives
            and businesses.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">Among the above electronic products, the tablet computer is a larger portable electronic
            device, so that the user can not hold it steadily during operation. Otherwise, when
            the tablet computer is placed on the tabletop, the screen of the tablet computer is
            parallel to the tabletop, so that the user must move his/her eyes to the top of the
            screen to view the displayed image. However, this posture usually results in shoulder
            soreness and eyestrain of the user, which is unhealthy to the users. Accordingly,
            the supporting device for the electronic device is introduced.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Regarding to the current supporting device of tablet computers, the available rotation
            angle and applications of most supporting devices are usually limited. If the supporting
            device is designed with larger rotation angle and better stability, it will have more
            complex structure and larger dimension, so that it is uncomfortable in carrying and
            operation. However, the portable simple supporting device can not firmly and stably
            fixed at the operation environment. If brief, when the user needs to operate the tablet
            computer for a long time or change operation locations frequently, the conventional
            supporting device can not fully support the requirements of the user. This may affect
            the portability and applications of the tablet computers.

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure discloses a supporting device applied to an electronic device
            and including a supporting unit, an adjusting unit and a fixing unit. The supporting
            unit supports the electronic device. The adjusting unit is connected to the supporting
            unit for adjusting an angle of the supporting unit. The fixing unit includes a locking
            part and a fixing part. The fixing part is fixed on a surface, and the locking part
            is connected to the adjusting unit. The locking part is detachably locked with the
            fixing part so as to fixing the electronic device on the surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the supporting unit has a clipping part for fixing the electronic
            device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the clipping part is adjustable with respect to the supporting
            unit.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the supporting device further comprises a first connector disposed
            on the supporting unit for connecting with the electronic device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the supporting device further comprises a second connector disposed
            on the locking part and electrically connected with the first connector.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the supporting device further comprises a third connector disposed
            on the fixing part. When the locking part is locked with the fixing part, the third
            connector is electrically connected with the second connector.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the inner wall of the locking part has a thread corresponding to
            a thread formed on outer wall of the fixing part.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the adjusting unit has a first adjusting member and a second adjusting
            member, and the first adjusting member is pivotly connected to the second adjusting
            member.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the locking part has a pivot, and the adjusting unit is mounted
            on the pivot so that it is rotatably connected to the locking part.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">As mentioned above, the supporting device of the disclosure has a supporting unit
            for supporting the electronic device and an adjusting unit for adjusting an angle
            of the electronic device with respect to a user. Accordingly, when operating the electronic
            device, the user can easily move to the optimum view angle and operate it for a long
            time.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">The locking part and fixing part of the fixing unit are detachable. Accordingly, the
            fixing part can be configured on an object surface at frequently used environments,
            and the user carries only the residual portion of the supporting device, thereby making
            the operation of the supporting device more convenient. Moreover, since it is unnecessary
            to carry the fixing part all the time, the design and material of the fixing part
            can be properly selected to enhance the stability. In this case, the heavy weight
            of the fixing part will not cause any uncomfortable in operation and can improve the
            fixing effect.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">Besides, the connection structure of the locking part and the fixing part is very
            simple, so that the supporting device can be easily and rapidly installed or uninstalled.
            For example, the locking part and the fixing part can be connected by corresponding
            screw threads. In practice, the supporting device of this disclosure can provide firm
            supporting and adjustable view angle. Compared with the conventional art, it is conveniently
            carried, easily assembled, and can achieve firmly fixing effect.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will become
            better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying
            drawings.
