      <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
      
      <div>
         <h1>FIELD</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to aircraft configurations and, more particularly,
            to configurations for minimizing wave drag of an air vehicle.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wave drag is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of the compression of air as an
            aircraft approaches the speed of sound. The compression generates a shock wave which
            may be accompanied by a localized change in the pressure and/or temperature of the
            air. At subsonic speeds, wave drag forms a relatively small portion of the overall
            aerodynamic drag on an aircraft. However, wave drag increases significantly as an
            aircraft approaches Mach 1.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Known methods of minimizing wave drag include designing an aircraft with a configuration
            that follows the Whitcomb Area Rule. The Whitcomb Area Rule dictates a minimization
            of change in the cross-sectional area of the aircraft in the longitudinal direction.
            In this regard, an aircraft following the Whitcomb Area Rule has a relatively smooth
            or gradual change in the size of the cross-sectional area regardless of changes in
            the cross-sectional shape. In conventional aircraft, the forward end of an aircraft
            fuselage may have a relatively small cross-sectional area. Unfortunately, the cross-sectional
            area may increase significantly and abruptly at the wings and/or engines and which
            may result in significant wave drag at transonic speeds.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Attempts to minimize changes in the longitudinal cross-sectional area of an aircraft
            including locally necking down the fuselage at the juncture with the wings to minimize
            the change in total cross-sectional area at that location. Unfortunately, designing
            and manufacturing an aircraft with a fuselage having a variable cross-sectional shape
            adds to the overall cost and complexity of the aircraft. In addition, in a commercial
            airliner, locally necking down the fuselage at the wings may be economically undesirable
            due the potential loss of revenue-generating passenger seats or cargo space.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another approach to minimizing wave drag in an aircraft is by forming the wings in
            a swept arrangement. Wing sweep may minimize changes in the longitudinal cross-sectional
            area of an aircraft by distributing the cross-sectional area of the wings over a longer
            length of the fuselage. Wing sweep may delay the onset of wave drag rise by increasing
            the Mach number required to generate shockwaves on the wing surface. The increase
            in Mach number may occur due to alignment of the pressure isobars with the sweep of
            the wing such that shocks will only form when the component of velocity perpendicular
            to the pressure isobars reaches sonic speeds. Unfortunately, excessive wing sweep
            may have an effect on the low speed performance of an aircraft. In addition, wing
            sweep may add cost and complexity to the aircraft design and manufacturing process.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">For aircraft operating at subsonic speeds, wave drag accounts for a relatively small
            portion of the total aerodynamic drag of the aircraft, as indicated above. However,
            a small reduction in wave drag may translate into a significant increase in fuel efficiency
            of the aircraft. Military aircraft that operate in the transonic region may also benefit
            from a reduction in wave drag with an increase in top speed and/or an increase in
            range.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">As can be seen, there exists a need in the art for an aircraft configuration that
            minimizes wave drag and which may be provided with minimal impact on the aircraft
            design and manufacturing process.
         </p>
      </div>

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-noted needs associated with minimizing wave drag are specifically addressed
            and alleviated by the present disclosure which provides an air vehicle having a bilaterally
            asymmetric configuration. The air vehicle may include a body having a longitudinal
            axis. The air vehicle may further include longitudinally offset engine nacelles, asymmetrically
            lengthened engine nacelles, and/or longitudinally offset protruding aerodynamic surfaces
            including stabilizers, control surfaces, and/or high aspect ratio wings.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment, the air vehicle may comprise an aircraft having a bilaterally
            asymmetric configuration. The aircraft may include a fuselage and an engine nacelle
            mounted on each one of opposing sides of the fuselage. The engine nacelle on one side
            of the fuselage may have a forward nacelle extension. The engine nacelle on an opposite
            side of the fuselage may have an aft nacelle extension.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also disclosed is a method of minimizing wave drag of an air vehicle. The method may
            include providing a body of an air vehicle having a longitudinal axis oriented generally
            parallel to a forward flight direction, and longitudinally offsetting at least one
            pair of components on opposite sides of the body relative to the longitudinal axis.
            The components may comprise engine nacelles, high aspect ratio wings, stabilizers,
            control surfaces, and/or external stores.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The features, functions and advantages that have been discussed can be achieved independently
            in various embodiments of the present disclosure or may be combined in yet other embodiments,
            further details of which can be seen with reference to the following description and
            drawings below.

            <b>110</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0037" num="0036">The body 
            <b>104</b> of the aircraft

            <b>170</b> extending from a fuselage forward end 
            <b>172</b> to a fuselage aft end 
            <b>174</b>. The fuselage aft end 
            <b>174</b> may include an empennage 
            <b>260</b>. The empennage 
            <b>260</b> may include one or more tail surfaces such as one or more stabilizers 
            <b>268</b> and/or control surfaces. For example, the empennage

            <b>268</b>, one or more vertical stabilizers 
            <b>262</b>, and one or more control surfaces 
            <b>272</b> such as an elevator (not shown) and/or a rudder (not shown) for directional control
            of the aircraft

            <b>132</b> of the aircraft 
            <b>102</b> in figref[FIG. 1]
            	, the stabilizers 
            <b>268</b> are arranged in a bilaterally symmetric configuration 
            <b>130</b> wherein the horizontal stabilizers

            <b>104</b> or fuselage 
            <b>170</b>. For example, the aircraft 
            <b>102</b> may include a pair of wings 
            <b>192</b> that may be mounted on opposite sides of the fuselage 
            <b>170</b>. The wings 
            <b>192</b> on each side of the fuselage 
            <b>170</b> may be configured substantially similar to one another. For example, the wings 
            <b>192</b> on each side of the fuselage 
            <b>170</b> may generally have the same size, shape, contour, airfoil sections, wing span, taper
            ratio, sweep (e.g., forward or aft), and dihedral or anhedral. Although shown in an
            aftwardly swept and tapered configuration, the wings

            <b>192</b> may have an aspect ratio of wingspan (not shown) to average chord (not shown) of
            at least 2. In an embodiment of a commercial airliner similar to that which is shown

            	, the high aspect ratio wings 
            <b>192</b> may be provided in an aspect ratio in the range of from approximately 2 to 10 or

            <b>192</b> with the fuselage 
            <b>170</b>. In the baseline configuration 
            <b>132</b> of the aircraft
