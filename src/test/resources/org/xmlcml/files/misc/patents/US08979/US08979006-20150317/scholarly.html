         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The rapid proliferation of portable electronic devices has resulted in a growing challenge
            as to how to cost effectively manage the disposal of batteries used to power these
            devices. The normal waste disposal infrastructure is not equipped to properly handle
            discarded batteries. Batteries contain materials and chemicals that, if allowed to
            leak into the environment, pose a significant threat. In addition, some battery technologies
            require materials that are costly to produce or are in limited supply. In many cases
            these materials may be recovered from the discards and reused, at considerable economic
            advantage. Battery recycling can provide both environmental and economic advantages.
            The practicality of battery recycling however is complicated by the large quantity
            of discarded batteries, the variety of battery sizes and physical configurations and
            battery technologies employing diverse chemical agents, elements and packaging materials.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">A practical battery recycling process takes in a bulk load of discarded batteries
            of all types. As each battery type contains different materials, chemicals, and packaging
            components separate recycling should be employed for each battery type. The output
            of the battery recycling process is the various recyclable materials gathered into
            groupings suitable for recovery of the constituent compounds and materials by refining
            or other separation processing. The battery recycling process, by itself, should minimize
            harmful environmental impact.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In embodiments, there is disclosed a method for processing discarded batteries thereby
            separating the constituent materials and chemicals into concentrated groupings which
            are suitable for refining into reusable materials. The method begins with receiving
            the discarded batteries in bulk, sorting the discarded batteries in accordance with
            battery technology type, separately crushing each of the battery types using an appropriate
            method, and collecting concentrated groupings of constituent materials and chemicals.
            Each of the concentrated groupings may be submitted for smelting or refining there
            by recovering the reusable materials.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In embodiments there is provided a method for recycling batteries comprising: receiving
            a plurality of batteries; sorting the plurality of batteries into groups by battery
            technology; removing button-cell batteries from the groups; chopping the groups of
            batteries into pieces approximately one quarter inch or less to produce final particulate
            matter; removing ferro-magnetic material from the final particulate matter; transferring
            the final particulate matter to metal refiner; and preparing and outputting a report.
            In an embodiment for recycling Lithium-ion and Li-polymer batteries, the chopping
            further comprises: first chopping into pieces one inch or less wherein released gases
            are removed from the first chopping; and second chopping into pieces one quarter inch
            or less. In an embodiment for recycling Nickel-metal-hydride (Ni-MH) batteries, the
            chopping further comprises a single chopping or crushing into pieces one quarter inch
            or less. In an embodiment the removing ferro-magnetic material is performed using
            a magnetic separator. In a further embodiment, the removing button-cell batteries
            step is performed by passing them through a metal sieve.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">In embodiments, the battery recycling method is a multi-step process comprising receiving
            discarded batteries in bulk containers, sorting the received batteries into groups
            of like technology, separately chopping or crushing each of the groups of batteries,
            and submitting the resulting battery materials for refining or smelting. The refining
            or smelting operation recovers and purifies the recyclable materials.
         </p>
         <p id="h-0006" num="0000">Receiving</p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the discarded batteries are received in unsorted bulk containers.
            The containers may contain a variety of battery types including but not limited to
            Lead acid, Li-Ion, Polymer, Ni—Cd; Mercury, Ni-Mh, Lithium primary and Alkaline. In
            addition the containers may contain complete or partial electronic devices containing
            batteries. Other assorted waste may also be included in these containers.
         </p>
         <p id="h-0007" num="0000">Sorting</p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the contents of the containers are sorted to separate the contents.
            The contents of the containers are emptied a rubber conveyer belt. As the conveyer
            belt moves slowly the contents are sorted into three categories: 1) WEEE (electronic)
            waste, 2) Burnable waste-wood, paper, plastic and 3) unusable waste.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">As appropriate, outer plastic battery casing and packaging materials are removed from
            the battery. Employees, by hand, separate the outer plastic casing from the batteries.
            These casings may enclose either the battery or the battery installed in a product.
            The removed casings may be smelted to recover cobalt and other materials. In a non-limiting
            embodiment this process may be manually performed. The batteries are contained in
            the electronic waste and, with the exception of small lithium primary and alkaline
            batteries, are further sorted and separated into separate containers as follows:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>a) Lead</li>
               
               <li>b) Li-Ion, Polymer</li>
               
               <li>c) Ni—Cd</li>
               
               <li>d) Mercury</li>
               
               <li>e) Ni-MH</li>
               
               <li>f) Lithium (large primary)
                  
                  <br></br>
                  Removing Small Lithium Primary Batteries
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0017">As part of the battery sorting process, small lithium primary batteries, or button
            cells, and alkaline batteries should be removed for proper operation of the recycling
            system. Button cell batteries are round, approximately a half-inch in diameter and
            an eighth of an inch in width. Their size makes them difficult to mechanically crush
            into pieces suitable for processing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0018">In an embodiment, the button cell batteries are removed by passing them through a
            metal sieve. This sieve consists of approx. 15 “V” shaped metal ridges, which are
            all connected such that the same piece of metal forms the left side of one ridge and
            the right side of another ridge. The left and right sides are at an approximately
            45 degree angle such that any small object would fall to the middle of each ridge.
            The side of each ridge is approximately one inch long. The bottom of each ridge, what
            one could call the bottom of the “V,” is empty. It is an open slot approximately one-quarter
            of an inch wide. Thus any small button cell battery that was on top of the “V” would
            slide to the bottom of the ridge, and then through it
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0019">The metal bars which form the left side of one “V” and the right side of another are
            approximately each 10 feet long. These metal bars are placed directly next to a rubber
            conveyer belt of equal width.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0020">The smaller lithium button cell batteries and alkaline batteries remain on the conveyer
            belt and thus pass from the conveyer belt to the metal “V” shaped ridges. The bars
            which form the sides of the ridges shake at a moderate pace. This encourages the smaller
            batteries to fall to the bottom of the ridge and then through the ridge. They then
            fall into boxes placed below the ridge.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0021">The larger items that do not fall though the ridges are alkaline batteries which are
            the only batteries remaining on the conveyor belt may be readily gathered.
         </p>
         <p id="h-0008" num="0000">Crushing</p>
         <p id="h-0009" num="0000">Processing Lithium-Ion and Li-Polymer Batteries</p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0022">Lithium-ion and Li-polymer batteries may contain Co, Ni, Cu, Al, C, as well as rare
            earth elements. These component materials may be recovered and recycled by a refining
            process.
         </p>
         <p id="h-0010" num="0000">First Crushing:</p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0023">In an embodiment, once the batteries have been sorted, then either lithium-ion and
            lithium polymer batteries together, or nickel-metal-hydride batteries by themselves,
            will be put thought a crushing process. The crushing process commences with the batteries
            being placed on a first flat, rubber conveyor belt. This conveyer belt may be approximately
            20 feet long. The batteries fall off the end of the first conveyor belt onto a second
            rubber conveyor belt.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0024">This second rubber conveyor belt is tilted upward at an approximately 45 degree angle.
            In an embodiment, a slab of rubber is attached to the second rubber conveyer belt
            at intervals of approximately 1.5 feet. This slab is approximately 2 inches in height,
            and transverse the width of the conveyor belt. This rubber slab picks up the batteries
            as they fall off the first flat rubber conveyor belt. The second rubber conveyor belt
            may be approximately 20 feet long. The second conveyer belt delivers the batteries
            into the input of a first metal crusher.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0025">In an embodiment, the first crusher rotates at approximately 100-400 revolutions per
            minute. These batteries are crushed (or chopped) by a device with teeth or blades
            of approximately 8 inches long. The blades or teeth cut into each battery, thereby
            breaking it into pieces approximately 0.5 to 1.0 inches in length. The operation of
            the first crusher may be monitored by a computer and the speed of the crusher may
            thereby be automatically adjusted to insure that the resulting battery pieces are
            of the desired size.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0026">The temperature within the first crusher should be maintained between 40 and 50 degrees
            Celsius. The relatively low temperature minimizes the risk of fire.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0027">During the first crushing process hydrogen and oxygen are released from the batteries.
            These gases should be removed from the crusher to minimize the risk of fire. A cyclonic
            air mover removes all of the gases, including hydrogen and oxygen, accumulated within
            the crusher. The cyclonic air mover may comprise a spinning blade at the top of a
            chamber that is tapered so it gets narrower as the gases moves towards the bottom
            of the chamber. This creates a tornado-like effect that blows the air containing the
            gases down, through the chamber of the air mover, and exhausts them out of the chamber.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0028">The air containing the gases that is exhausted out of the air mover is then passed
            through a filter. The exhausted gases also contain light plastic and cardboard, which
            comprised the batteries and their packaging. This plastic and cardboard should be
            removed because they would interfere with the recovery of valuable materials during
            the cobalt refining process.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0029">The filter removes the light plastic and cardboard that was suspended in the exhaust
            gases. The filtered light plastic and cardboard contains materials that may be recovered
            by a Nickel smelting process. Note that the heavy plastic, which, generally speaking,
            formed the outside casings of the batteries, remains mixed with the metal in the crushed
            battery mix.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0030">This mixture of light plastic and cardboard is added to the process of recycling Nickel
            Metal Hydride batteries (see below). This light plastic and cardboard is thus sent,
            along with the other parts of the recycled Nickel Metal Hydride batteries, for Nickel
            smelting. The Nickel smelting operation removes the very small amount of cobalt (2-4%)
            in the mixture, particularly that which remains attached to the light plastic. The
            remainder is then sent for Cobalt processing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0031">After filtering, the air that contains the hydrogen and oxygen is exhausted to the
            atmosphere via a second filter. The second filter catches any remaining particles,
            insuring that only particulate-free air is released.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0032">A filter screen positioned on the output of the first crusher has multiple apertures
            sized to insure that only pieces smaller than the desired maximum size are permitted
            to exit the crusher. After passing through this first crushing chamber, the mix of
            battery pieces and dust passes into a second transfer tube. While in this second transfer
            tube, the mix is cooled down to room temperature.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0033">The second transfer tube is approximately 10 inches in diameter and is air-tight.
            The pieces and dust mixture will pass through this tube to the second crushing chamber.
         </p>
         <p id="h-0011" num="0000">Second Crushing:</p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0034">The second transfer tube brings the dust to a second crusher. This crusher is of the
            same basic design as the first crusher but is made to operate at a higher rotational
            speed. It turns at 1,000-1,200 revolutions per minute and reduces the battery pieces
            to 0-6 mm.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0030" num="0035">The second crusher produces more dust that may be collected in a second cyclone air
            mover. This second cyclone has two dust filters having the same filtering properties
            as the second filter from the first cyclone.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0031" num="0036">A powder results from the second crushing of the battery pieces. The powder exits
            the second crusher and is placed on a “shaker-mover” device that, in an embodiment,
            may be implemented as a vibrating conveyor belt, which slowly shakes the powder so
            as to cause it to move forward. The powder moves approximately 2.5 meters along the
            vibrating conveyer belt. While the powder is on this conveyer belt it passes under
            the magnetic separator.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0032" num="0037">In an embodiment, the magnetic separator pulls the iron from the powder. This iron
            is in the form of flakes. The magnetic separator is positioned about 25 cm above the
            vibrating conveyor belt. The magnetic separator is approximately a half-meter wide
            and two and a half meters long. The key component of the magnetic separator is a magnet.
            The iron flakes are attracted to this magnet thereby be separated from the powder.
            A third conveyer belt is located below the magnet. The magnet behind the belt attracts
            and then holds the iron flakes onto the belt. The belt that carries the iron flakes
            out of the attractive magnetic field. In an embodiment the conveyor belt may be approximately
            40 centimeters long. The flakes then fall off the end of the belt and into a container.
            The iron flakes may reclaimed by smelting.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0033" num="0038">The remaining powder, from which the iron flakes has been removed, may be refined
            to recover cobalt and copper that comprises over 93% of the powder.
         </p>
         <p id="h-0012" num="0000">Processing Nickel-Metal-Hydride Batteries</p>
         <p id="p-0034" num="0039">Nickel-metal-hydride (Ni-MH) batteries may comprise Ni, Co, Fe, Al, C, Cd, and rare
            earth elements. These component materials may be recovered and recycled by a refining
            process.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0035" num="0040">Nickel-metal-hydride (Ni-MH) battery recycle processing poses a minimal fire risk
            and expelled gases and dust need not be controlled. Processing of Ni-MH batteries
            may thus be accomplished by a single high rotation speed crushing operation. Here
            again, as with the second crushing operation described above, the crusher operates
            at a higher rotational speed of 1,000-1,200 revolutions per minute and reduces the
            battery pieces to 0-6 mm.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0036" num="0041">The light plastic and cardboard waste generated during the lithium ion, lithium polymer
            recycling process, described above, is mixed with the Ni-MH batteries as they are
            being recycled. This material is thus sold, along with the material that was derived
            from the Ni-MH batteries, to a nickel smelter. This smelter uses the light material
            as a energy, thus deriving energy from the light material derived from the lithium
            ion and lithium polymer batteries.
         </p>
         <p id="h-0013" num="0000">Processing Alkaline Batteries</p>
         <p id="p-0037" num="0042">Alkaline batteries contain caustic materials and mercury and should be processed in
            a manner that protects personnel, processing equipment and the environment from the
            deleterious effects of caustic alkaline and mercury content.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0038" num="0043">Alkaline batteries are separately crushed at room temperature to minimize the reactivity
            of mercury and the caustic electrolyte. As is the case for Ni-MH batteries, alkaline
            batteries are processed by a single high rotation speed crushing operation. The crusher
            operates at a rotational speed of 1,000-1,200 revolutions per minute and reduces the
            battery pieces to 0-6 mm. Alkaline battery materials are very corrosive. Machinery
            used for alkaline battery processing should therefore have surfaces made of rubber,
            stainless steel, or other rustproof materials.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0039" num="0044">After crushing, the iron which makes up 20-23% of the contents of an alkaline battery
            is magnetically separated. The iron may be recovered by a refining process. The material
            remaining after the iron is removed, called a black mass, contains approximately 25%
            zinc and 30% manganese which may be recovered by refining.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0040" num="0045">Alkaline batteries should be processed separately in a crusher that is sealed to the
            environment and includes provision for capturing all of the recovered mercury.
