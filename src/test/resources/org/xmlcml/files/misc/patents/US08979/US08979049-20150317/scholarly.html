         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to mount bracket systems, and more specifically, to
            a mount bracket system configured to anchor a target object such as a display device
            to a wall-mount frame on a wall through a wall-mount part.

         <h1>BACKGROUND ART</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, progress has been made in slimming down of display devices such as television
            sets. The slimming down of display devices has enabled the display devices to be hung
            on walls by means of mount bracket systems. The mount bracket system is a system which
            includes a wall-mount part and a wall-mount frame and is configured to hang, e.g.,
            a display device on a wall by securing the wall-mount part on the backside of the
            display device and by anchoring the wall-mount part to the wall-mount frame mounted
            on the wall. Many houses and commercial facilities actually have display devices mounted
            on walls in this manner.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1 describes a conventional mount bracket system. The conventional
            mount bracket system for a display device will be described below with reference to
            figref[FIGS. 10 and 11]
            	.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">figref[FIG. 10]
            	 illustrates how a wall-mount part included in the conventional mount bracket system
            for a display device is secured to a target object. The wall-mount part 
            <b>100</b> includes an axis portion 
            <b>100</b>
            <i>a </i>and a stopper 
            <b>100</b>

            <b>300</b> includes a path 
            <b>400</b> which is a groove bends at an intermediate point. The wall-mount part 
            <b>100</b> is anchored to the wall-mount frame 
            <b>300</b> by inserting the axis portion 
            <b>100</b>

      <div>
         <h1>Technical Problem</h1>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in view of the fact that the wall-mount part 
            <b>100</b> has a circular cross section as illustrated in figref[FIG. 11]
            	, when an upward force is applied to the target object, a collision between the axis
            portion 
            <b>100</b>
            <i>a </i>of the wall-mount part 
            <b>100</b> and an upper edge portion 
            <b>500</b> of the path 
            <b>400</b> causes a resultant force acting on the axis portion 
            <b>100</b>
            <i>a </i>and having a horizontal component.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, the conventional mount bracket system is disadvantageous in that the target
            object may be easily moved in a diagonally upward direction by an upward impact.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is therefore an object of the present disclosure to provide a mount bracket system
            which is capable of anchoring a target object such that the target object is less
            likely to be moved by an upward impact.

      </div>
      
      
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>Solution to the Problem</h1>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">To achieve the object, a mount bracket system of the present disclosure is configured
            such that a path through which an axis portion of a wall-mount part included in the
            mount bracket system passes has a projection, and the projection is located nearer
            an opening of the path than a retaining point for the axis portion is, and projects
            inward from an edge of the path.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">Specifically, the mount bracket system of the present disclosure includes: a wall-mount
            part including an axis portion with a cylindrical column shape, and a stopper provided
            at the axis portion and having a width larger than a diameter of the axis portion;
            and a wall-mount frame including a path continuing from an opening and having a width
            larger than the diameter of the axis portion and smaller than the width of the stopper,
            wherein the path includes a projection projecting inward from an edge of the path,
            and the projection is located nearer the opening than the axis portion of the wall-mount
            part is when the axis portion is retained at a retaining point of the wall-mount frame.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>Advantages of the Invention</h1>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the mount bracket system of the present disclosure, even if an upward force is
            applied to a target object, the projection provided on the edge of the path and located
            on a side adjacent to the opening controls movements of the wall-mount part. Consequently,
            it is possible to prevent the target object from becoming detached from the wall-mount
            frame.

            applied to the target object 
            <b>1</b>, the configuration of the wall-mount frame

            <b>2</b>. As a result, it is possible to prevent the target object

         <p id="p-0075" num="0074">Any article such as various electrical products, heavy objects, and exhibits may be
            selected as the target object

            liquid crystal display panel, a clock, or a painting may be selected as the target
            object.

         <p id="p-0076" num="0075">However, the present disclosure is particularly useful when a display device is selected

            to upward impacts applied from below the target object, the present disclosure is
            useful for installing the target object within arm's reach of a user.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0077" num="0076">Since the present disclosure allows a target object to move in a specific direction
            other than the vertical direction, the present disclosure is useful for hanging a
            target object in a detachable manner.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0078" num="0077">The stability of the present disclosure increases in proportion to the weight of a
            target object when the target object is stationary. Therefore, the present disclosure
            is effective for a heavy object.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0079" num="0078">In view of the above three advantages of the present disclosure, it is preferable

      <h2>claim</h2>
      
      <div>
         <h2>CLAIM-TEXT</h2>1. A mount bracket system for a display device, the mount bracket system comprising:
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>a wall-mount part for the display device, the wall-mount part including an axis portion
         with a cylindrical column shape, and a stopper provided at the axis portion and having
         a width larger than a diameter of the axis portion; and
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>a wall-mount frame including a path continuing straight downwardly from an opening
         and having a width larger than the diameter of the axis portion and smaller than the
         width of the stopper,
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>wherein
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>the path includes a projection projecting inward from an edge of the path,
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>the projection is located nearer the opening than the axis portion of the wall-mount
         part is when the axis portion is retained in a cylindrical portion of the wall-mount
         frame,
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>the path extends diagonally relative to a vertical direction between the opening and
         the cylindrical portion, and
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>the cylindrical portion continuing downwardly from the projection, defining a gap
         larger than the width of the path, and configured to support the axis portion.
         
      </div>
      
      
      <h2>claim</h2>
      
      <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>2. The mount bracket system of claim-ref[claim 1]
      	, wherein the projection is located above the axis portion of the wall-mount part
      when the axis portion is retained in the cylindrical portion of the wall-mount frame.
