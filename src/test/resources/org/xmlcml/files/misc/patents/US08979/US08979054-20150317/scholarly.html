      <p>A wall mountable storage assembly including a storage device, at least one mounting
         plate, and at least one double-faced adhesive. The storage device includes a coupling
         bracket forming a first engagement feature. The mounting plate forms a second engagement
         feature. The first and second engagement features have a complimentary construction
         configured to provide a releasable snap fit connection in which the mounting plate
         can articulate relative to the coupling bracket. The adhesive is configured to be
         arranged between the mounting plate and a wall, with the mounting plate articulating
         relative to the coupling bracket to facilitate complete contact between the adhesive
         and the wall. The storage device can include two spaced-apart coupling brackets. Two
         of the mounting plates are provided, each carrying adhesive. The mounting plates can
         articulate independent of one another, accommodating variations in flatness of the
         wall to which the storage assembly is mounted.

      <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to storage devices (e.g., caddies, shelves, etc.) that
            can be adhesively mounted to a wall. More particularly, it relates to wall mountable
            storage devices useful to hold a variety of items and adhesively mounted to various
            wall surfaces, including uneven and/or non-flat wall surfaces, such as a bath or shower
            enclosure wall.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Adhesives (e.g., pressure sensitive adhesives) have often found use in attaching articles
            to surfaces. For example, double-faced adhesive strips (i.e., strips bearing adhesive
            on both opposing major surfaces) are widely known and used. In particular, stretch-releasing
            adhesive strips and tapes have found use in a wide variety of assembly, joining, attaching,
            and mounting applications.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">One such exemplary use of double-faced adhesives is to hold or mount a storage device
            (e.g., shelves, containers, baskets, caddies, etc.) to a wall. For example, shower
            and bath storage devices, often referred to as a shower or bath caddy, are commonly
            used to hold and/or store items such as soap, shampoo, and other bath items in shower
            and bath enclosures. Because of the weight of the stored items and because it is generally
            not practical to mount such items to the shower or bath enclosure wall using mechanical
            fasteners (e.g., nails or screws), such devices are typically hung from the shower
            nozzle fixture. Other techniques include mounting the storage device to the shower
            or bath wall with suction cups; however, suction cups have limited holding capacity
            and tend to lose their holding ability over time. To address these problems, shower
            caddies and other storage or organizing devices have been devised that utilize stretch-releasable
            adhesive tapes to secure the storage device to the shower wall. For example, 3M Command
            Shower Caddyâ¢ products available from 3M Company of St. Paul, Minn. are available
            and have been well received.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variety of mounting plate or backplate constructions have been developed that facilitate
            secure connection between the storage device and the double-faced adhesive (and thus
            the wall to which the storage device is mounted). In general terms, the mounting plate
            serves as an intermediate structure that mechanically connects the storage device
            with the double-faced adhesive. The mounting plate provides a bracket or other mounting
            fixture along one side, and is directly attached to the adhesive along the opposite
            side. The storage device, in turn, carries a complimentary bracket or fixture configured
            to releasably engage the mounting plate's bracket, preferably in a snap fit engagement.
            Mounting of the storage device to a wall surface includes the mounting plate attached
            to the storage device, a first side of the adhesive secured to the mounting plate,
            and a second side of the adhesive connected to the wall surface. When removal of the
            entire assembly from the wall is desired, the storage device is first disconnected
            from the mounting plate. Once the storage device is removed, the mounting plate/adhesive
            can easily be accessed and released from the wall surface (e.g., stretch-releasing
            the adhesive). Similar designs and mounting techniques are commonly employed for other
            wall mountable storage devices that are not necessarily intended to be used in a shower
            or bath environment.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many instances, the storage device in question is relatively long (e.g., 6 inches
            or more) and is intended to be maintained in a horizontal orientation. Under these
            circumstances, one or more individual strips of the double-faced adhesive are applied
            at or adjacent opposite ends of the storage device (via the mounting plates described
            above) to provide robust support upon mounting to a wall surface. Where the elongated
            storage device is mounted to a flat wall surface by two spaced apart mounting plates/adhesives,
            the above-described formats are highly efficient. As a point of reference, it is desirable
            to provide a rigid, snap fit connection between the mounting plates and the storage
            device. While this construction is highly beneficial in establishing necessary support
            of the storage device relative to the wall surface, variations in flatness of the
            wall surface can prevent complete contact (or âwettingâ) between the adhesive and
            the wall surface from occurring. A typical mounting technique first entails connecting
            the two (or more) mounting plates to the storage device (such that the two mounting
            plates are spaced from one another), and then exposing an adhesive face of the double-faced
            adhesive carried by each the mounting plates. The exposed adhesives are then brought
            into contact with the wall surface typically by directing the storage device toward
            the wall surface. Where the wall surface is not flat across the spacing distance between
            the two mounting plates, one or both of the exposed adhesive faces may not come into
            complete contact with the wall surface. This concern is more prevalent in certain
            end-use environments such as shower and bath enclosures (e.g., a tiled bath wall surface
            is inherently uneven from tile-to-tile, fiberglass shower walls typically have a slight
            curvature, etc.).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In light of the above, a need exists for a storage device that can be adhesively mounted
            to a wall surface of a shower or bath enclosure (or other potentially uneven or non-flat
            wall surface) in a manner promoting thorough contact between spaced apart exposed
            adhesive surfaces and the uneven or non-flat wall.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some aspects of the present disclosure relate to a wall mountable storage assembly.
            The storage assembly includes a storage device, at least one mounting plate, and at
            least one double-faced adhesive. The storage device includes a main body and at least
            one coupling bracket. The main body can have a variety of forms (e.g., caddy, shelf,
            etc.). The coupling bracket is attached to the main body and forms a first engagement
            feature. The mounting plate forms a bonding face and a second engagement feature.
            The bonding face is adapted to receive the double-faced adhesive and the second engagement
            feature is formed opposite the bonding face. The first and second engagement features
            have a complimentary construction configured to provide a releasable snap fit connection
            of the mounting plate with the coupling bracket. In this regard, the snap fit connection
            includes the mounting plate being articulatable relative to the coupling bracket.
            The double-faced adhesive is configured to be arranged between the bonding face and
            a wall for securing the storage assembly to the wall. With this construction, the
            storage assembly can be mounted to a wall surface, with the mounting plate articulating
            relative to the coupling bracket (and thus relative to the storage device) to facilitate
            complete contact between the adhesive and the wall, while retaining the snap fit connection.
            In some embodiments, the coupling bracket provides a cross-bar as the first engagement
            feature, whereas the mounting plate includes a finger serving as the second engagement
            feature. The cross-bar forms a curved (e.g., convex curve) shape about which a substantially
            flat surface of the mounting plate can articulate. In related embodiments, the finger
            forms a tent-like or tapering shape about which a substantially flat surface of the
            coupling bracket can articulate and/or presents minimal interference to the mounting
            plate articulating along the cross-bar curved shape. With embodiments in which the
            storage device has an elongated length and is formatted to be mounted such that the
            length is substantially horizontal, the first and second engagement features are configured
            such that articulation of the mounting plate relative to the storage device includes
            the mounting plate effectively pivoting about an axis that is substantially vertical.
            In yet other embodiments, the storage device includes two of the coupling brackets,
            with the coupling brackets being longitudinally spaced from one another. Two of the
            mounting plates are also provided, with each mounting plate carrying, or adapted to
            carry, a piece or strip of the double-faced adhesive. With these constructions, when
            the mounting plates are engaged with a corresponding one of the coupling brackets
            in the releasable snap fit connection, the mounting plates can articulate relative
            to the storage device independent of one another, thereby accommodating variations
            in flatness of the wall surface to which the storage assembly is mounted.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other aspects in accordance with principles of the present disclosure relate to a
            method of mounting a storage device to a wall. A storage device is received, with
            the storage device including a main body, and first and second coupling brackets.
            The coupling brackets are longitudinally spaced from one another, and each includes
            a first engagement feature. A second engagement feature of a first mounting plate
            is snap fitted to the first engagement feature of the first coupling bracket, and
            a second engagement feature of a second mounting plate is snap fitted to the first
            engagement feature of the second coupling bracket. An adhesive surface of a double-faced
            adhesive carried by each of the mounting plates is exposed. The storage device is
            moved toward the wall such that the exposed adhesive surfaces initially contact the
            wall. At least one of the mounting plates is articulated relative to the main body
            such that the exposed adhesive surfaces fully contact and bond to the wall. In this
            regard, the mounting plates retain the snap fit connection to the corresponding coupling
            bracket with articulation of the mounting plate relative to the main body.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">One embodiment of a storage assembly 
            <b>20</b> in accordance with principles of the present disclosure is shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	. The assembly 
            <b>20</b> includes a storage device 
            <b>22</b>, at least one mounting plate 
            <b>24</b>, and at least one double-faced adhesive 
            <b>26</b>. Details on the various components are provided below. In general terms, however,
            the mounting plates 
            <b>24</b> couple with corresponding components (i.e., coupling brackets hidden in the view
            of figref[FIG. 1]
            	) of the storage device 
            <b>22</b> in a releasable snap fit connection. In this regard, an interface between each of
            the mounting plates 
            <b>24</b> and the corresponding coupling bracket is configured to promote articulation of the
            mounting plates 
            <b>24</b> relative to the storage device 
            <b>22</b> while maintaining the snap fit connection. The double-faced adhesives 
            <b>26</b> are adhered to corresponding ones of the mounting plates 
            <b>24</b>, and serve to adhesively bond the assembly 
            <b>20</b> to a wall surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">With additional reference to figref[FIG. 2]
            	, the storage device 
            <b>22</b> includes a main body or frame 
            <b>40</b> configured to provide a desired storage or organizational attribute(s). For example,
            in the embodiment shown, the main body 
            <b>40</b> is a caddy or basket sized and shaped to receive and contain various articles of
            interest (e.g., shampoo bottle, soap, body wash, etc.). Alternatively, the main body
            
            <b>40</b> can consist of or include a shelf, a rail or similar structure and/or can provide
            other storage features of interest (e.g., a holder configured to retain a particular
            object such as a hand-held razor, etc.). Even further, the main body 
            <b>40</b> can provide multiple shelves, multiple caddies, a single caddy with one or more dividers,
            etc. Alternatively, the storage device main body 
            <b>40</b> can include or carry a mirror. Regardless, the main body 
            <b>40</b> has an elongated length defined, for example, by a primary shelf or base 
            <b>42</b> (e.g., with the construction of figref[FIGS. 1 and 2]
            	, where the main body 
            <b>40</b> is a caddy, the shelf 
            <b>42</b> constitutes a bottom of the caddy). It will be understood that a construction of
            the primary shelf 
            <b>42</b> is not of particular importance to principles of the present disclosure; rather,
            reference is made to the primary shelf 
            <b>42</b> for purposes of designating an intended orientation of the main body 
            <b>40</b> during use. A longitudinal (or length) direction defined or generated by a shape
            of the elongated main body 
            <b>40</b> (e.g., by the shelf 
            <b>42</b>) is designated by the arrow X in figref[FIG. 2]
            	, and a transverse (or height) direction perpendicular to the length by the arrow
            Y. A depth direction (Z) is into the plane of the page of figref[FIG. 2]
            	. In some embodiments, the storage device main body 
            <b>40</b> is sized and shaped such that the shelf 
            <b>42</b> is intended to be arranged in a horizontal orientation upon final mounting of the
            storage device 
            <b>22</b> to a wall. This orientation is reflected in figref[FIG. 2]
            	, with the horizontal direction corresponding with the longitudinal direction X. In
            this same spatial orientation, the vertical direction corresponds with the transverse
            direction Y. As made clear below, various other features of the storage assembly 
            <b>20</b> can be described with respect to the horizontal and vertical (or longitudinal and
            transverse) directions X, Y established by the intended orientation of the storage
            device 
            <b>22</b>. It will be understood, however, that the storage device 
            <b>22</b>, and in particular the main body 
            <b>40</b>, can be configured for other spatial orientations in which the primary shelf 
            <b>42</b> is not necessarily horizontal. The terms âlongitudinalâ and âhorizontalâ are used
            interchangeably throughout this disclosure, as are the terms âtransverseâ and âverticalâ.
            It should be understood that those terms are used in their relative sense only for
            ease of explanation and are not limiting. For example, reference to the âhorizontal
            directionâ of a feature of a particular object does not limit that object or feature
            to only being oriented horizontally.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">The main body 
            <b>40</b> can be made of any desired material or combination of materials. For example, the
            main body 
            <b>40</b> can comprise a generally solid structure (e.g., a molded plastic article) that may
            have one or more perforations (e.g., for drainage, in the event that the assembly
            
            <b>20</b> is used as a shower caddy). The main body 
            <b>40</b> may encompass any conceivable shape and construction, so long as it may be attached
            to a wall as described herein. As another example, the main body 
            <b>40</b> may comprise a wire-rod structure (e.g., a wire basket).

            	, the storage device 
            <b>22</b> further includes at least one coupling bracket 
            <b>50</b> attached to, or formed by, the main body 
            <b>40</b>. While four of the coupling brackets 
            <b>50</b> are illustrated, in other embodiments a greater or lesser number can be provided.
            Regardless, the coupling brackets 
            <b>50</b> are configured to interface with a corresponding one of the mounting plates 
            <b>24</b> (figref[FIG. 1]
            	) as described below, and include or provide a first engagement feature 
            <b>52</b> (referenced generally). The coupling brackets 
            <b>50</b> can be generally identical and is shown in greater detail in figref[FIGS. 4A and 4B]
            	. For ease of explanation, only a portion of the main body 
            <b>40</b> is shown in figref[FIGS. 4A and 4B]
            	 and is illustrated in simplified form. In some constructions, the coupling bracket
            
            <b>50</b> includes first and second legs

            <b>60</b>, 
            <b>62</b>. The cross-bar 
            <b>64</b> serves as the first engagement feature 
            <b>52</b>, and is laterally spaced from the main body 
            <b>40</b> to establish a gap

            	, the cross-bar 
            <b>64</b> defines opposing, first and second major surfaces 
            <b>68</b>, 
            <b>70</b>. The first major surface 
            <b>68</b> âfacesâ the main body 
            <b>40</b> (and thus defines a portion of the confines of the gap 
            <b>66</b>), and the second major surface 
            <b>70</b> is opposite the first major surface 
            <b>68</b>. As a point of reference, a face 
            <b>72</b> of the main body 
            <b>40</b> in a region of the coupling bracket 
            <b>50</b> can be substantially flat (e.g., a flatness of the face 
            <b>72</b> varies by no more than 3% in the vertical direction Y), and each of the legs 
            <b>60</b>, 
            <b>62</b> projects in a substantially perpendicular fashion from the face 
            <b>72</b> (i.e., within 2% of a truly perpendicular relationship). The first and second legs
            
            <b>60</b>, 
            <b>62</b> can be substantially parallel with one another in extension along the vertical direction
            Y (shown in figref[FIG. 4A]
            	), and the second major surface 
            <b>70</b> extends between the legs 
            <b>60</b>, 
            <b>62</b> in the horizontal direction X. With this in mind, the second major surface 
            <b>70</b> is not substantially flat in the horizontal direction X, but instead forms a convex
            curvature in extension between the legs 
            <b>60</b>, 
            <b>62</b>. The second major surface 
            <b>70</b> can have a constant radius of curvature, forming an apex at a mid-point 
            <b>74</b> between the legs 
            <b>60</b>, 
            <b>62</b> (i.e., the second major surface 
            <b>70</b> defines a convex curve relative to a plane of the first major surface 
            <b>68</b> and/or relative to a plane of the main body face 
            <b>72</b> in the horizontal direction X). In some embodiments, the radius of curvature defined
            by the second major surface 
            <b>70</b> in the horizontal direction X is on the order of 2-8 inches. Conversely, the first
            major surface 
            <b>68</b> is substantially flat in the horizontal direction X (e.g., a flatness of the first
            major surface 
            <b>68</b> does not vary by more than 3% in the horizontal direction X between the legs 
            <b>60</b>, 
            <b>62</b>). As a point of reference, in some constructions the storage device 
            <b>22</b> (figref[FIG. 2]
            	) is a homogenous structure, including the main body 
            <b>40</b> and the coupling brackets 
            <b>50</b> being integrally formed (e.g., the storage device 
            <b>22</b> is an injection molded plastic article). With these and other manufacturing techniques,
            a tolerance range or engineering tolerance is assigned to various dimensional attributes
            of the finished product and establishes the acceptable limits to deviations from specified
            physical dimensions engineered into the product design due to manufacturing inconsistencies.
            The designed flatness of the first major surface 
            <b>68</b>, for example, can have an engineering tolerance of plus or minus 0.0015 inch. The
            arcuate or curved shape of the second major surface 
            <b>70</b> is well outside of this engineering tolerance range (or other tolerance range associated
            with the coupling bracket 
            <b>50</b>
            <i>a</i>) and can include, for example, a difference in âheightâ (relative to the orientation
            of figref[FIG. 4B]
            	) between the mid-point 
            <b>74</b> and the legs 
            <b>60</b>, 
            <b>62</b> of about 0.005-0.015 inch. In other words, the arcuate shape (e.g., convex curve)
            provided by the second major surface 
            <b>70</b> is specifically designed into the coupling bracket 
            <b>50</b>, and is not the unintended result of manufacturing variations.

            in the vertical direction Y (i.e., the cross-bar articulation axis A is substantially
            perpendicular to the plane of the shelf

            <b>122</b>. In this regard, the capture body 
            <b>132</b> can be described as defining an interior surface 
            <b>136</b> and an exterior surface 
            <b>138</b>. The interior surface 
            <b>136</b> âfacesâ the base 
            <b>102</b>, whereas the exterior surface 
            <b>138</b> is opposite the base 
            <b>102</b>. With this in mind, the finger 
            <b>104</b> is constructed to provide a biased or spring-like attribute to the capture body 
            <b>132</b>, whereby the capture body 
            <b>132</b> can deflect from the normal arrangement shown (effectively pivoting at the shoulder
            
            <b>130</b>), and self-revert back to the normal arrangement. The capture body 
            <b>132</b> includes a first segment 
            <b>140</b> extending from the shoulder 
            <b>130</b>, and a second segment 
            <b>142</b> extending from the first segment 
            <b>140</b> to a tip 
            <b>144</b>. The lateral spacing 
            <b>134</b> between the interior surface 
            <b>136</b> and the second major face 
            <b>122</b> of the base 
            <b>102</b> tapers along the second segment 
            <b>142</b> from the tip 
            <b>144</b> to the first segment 
            <b>140</b>. The lateral spacing 
            <b>134</b> along the first segment 
            <b>140</b> is relatively uniform. A step 
            <b>146</b> is formed as a protrusion from the interior surface 
            <b>136</b> at a transition between the first and second segments 
            <b>140</b>, 
            <b>142</b> and represents a further reduction in the lateral spacing 
            <b>134</b>. More particularly, a capture zone is established between the shoulder 
            <b>130</b> and the step 
            <b>146</b>, and is sized and shaped in accordance with a size and shape of the cross-bar 
            <b>64</b> (figref[FIG. 3]
            	). The lateral spacing 
            <b>134</b> at the step 
            <b>146</b> is less than a thickness of the cross-bar 
            <b>64</b>, and establishes the snap fit connection described below. In this regard, the step
            
            <b>146</b> and the shoulder 
            <b>130</b> combine to define opposing, first and second capture edges

            <i>a</i>, 
            <b>148</b>

            <b>24</b> interfaces with the cross-bar 
            <b>64</b> in snap fitted engagement. The capture edges

         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">As best shown in figref[FIG. 5D]
            	, the capture body 
            <b>132</b> further defines opposing edges 
            <b>150</b>, 
            <b>152</b>. The interior and exterior surfaces 
            <b>136</b>, 
            <b>138</b> extend between the edges 
            <b>150</b>, 
            <b>152</b>. In some embodiments, the interior surface 
            <b>136</b> along the first segment 
            <b>140</b> (figref[FIG. 5C]
            	) has a tent-like shape in extension between the opposing edges 
            <b>150</b>, 
            <b>152</b>. For example, figref[FIG. 5D]
            	 reflects the first segment interior surface 
            <b>136</b> forming a peak 
            <b>154</b>, and is recessed at opposite sides of the peak 
            <b>154</b> by reliefs 
            <b>156</b>
            <i>a</i>, 
            <b>156</b>
            <i>b</i>. The tent-like shape of the interior surface 
            <b>136</b> is distinct from allowable or tolerated deviations in flatness due to inherent manufacturing
            variations. For example, the engineering tolerance for allowable deviations from flatness
            can be less than 1 degree, whereas the shape of the interior surface 
            <b>136</b> represents a 2 degree (or more) relief (relative to the peak 
            <b>154</b>) from a truly flat arrangement. Thus, the tent-like shape of the interior surface
            
            <b>136</b> is specifically designed into the finger 
            <b>104</b> and is not the unintended result of manufacturing deviations. As made clear below,
            the tent-like shape of the interior surface 
            <b>136</b> facilitates (e.g., does not cause interference with) articulation of the mounting
            plate 
            <b>24</b> relative to the corresponding coupling bracket 
            <b>50</b> (figref[FIG. 3]
            	) at an interface between the mounting plate second major face 
            <b>122</b> and the cross-bar second major surface 
            <b>70</b> (figref[FIG. 4B]
            	). However, the tent-like shape terminates at or is otherwise not formed along the
            step 
            <b>146</b>. State otherwise, the reliefs 
            <b>156</b>
            <i>a</i>, 
            <b>156</b>
            <i>b </i>do not extend into the step 
            <b>146</b>. Thus, the step 
            <b>146</b> provides desired surface area for establishing a tight snap fit at the second capture
            edge

            disposed (e.g., coated) thereupon. Or the stretch-releasing adhesive can be formed
            of a solid, elastic pressure-sensitive adhesive. Thus, in this context, the term âstretch-releasing
            adhesiveâ encompasses products that comprise a unitary, integral, or solid construction
            of adhesive (in addition to products that comprise a backing with separate layers

            Such stretch-release adhesives can range, for example, from about 0.2 mm in thickness

            <b>24</b>, and one of the double-faced adhesives

            	. With this in mind, the double-faced adhesive 
            <b>26</b> is arranged such that the first major adhesive surface

            <b>52</b>, 
            <b>100</b> can be assembled to one another in a releasable snap fit connection. For example,

            	, the mounting plate 
            <b>24</b> is secured to the coupling bracket

         <p id="p-0052" num="0051">As further shown in figref[FIG. 7B]
            	, in the snap fit connection arrangement, the second major face

            <b>68</b> of the cross-bar 
            <b>64</b>. Due to the arcuate or convexly curved shape of the cross-bar second surface 
            <b>70</b> and the substantial flatness of the second major face 
            <b>122</b>, the second major face

            <i>a</i>, 
            <b>156</b>
            <i>b </i>along the interior surface

            <b>132</b> relative to the cross-bar 
            <b>64</b> as the mounting plate 
            <b>24</b> articulates relative to the coupling bracket 
            <b>50</b>. As shown by the arrow R in figref[FIG. 7C]
            	, then, the mounting plate 
            <b>24</b> can articulate (e.g., pivot and/or rock) relative to the coupling bracket 
            <b>50</b> (and thus relative to the main body 
            <b>40</b>), and vice-versa. In some embodiments, the mounting plate 
            <b>24</b> can pivot relative to the coupling bracket 
            <b>50</b> over a range of 1Â°-5Â° while retaining the snap fit connection. As a point of reference,
            the cross-bar articulation axis A is identified in figref[FIG. 7C]
            	. Because the component interface does permit possible sliding of the mounting plate
            second major face 
            <b>122</b> relative to the cross-bar second major surface 
            <b>70</b>, the final snap fit connection does not rigidly maintain contact of the mounting
            plate second major face 
            <b>122</b> at the cross-bar articulation axis A, nor does the mounting plate 
            <b>24</b> pivot relative to the coupling bracket

         <p id="p-0055" num="0054">The articulating attributes provided by storage assemblies of the present disclosure
            are further illustrated in the view of figref[FIG. 9]

            	, but shown in figref[FIG. 3]
            	). The snap fit interface between the mounting plate

            aligned with the articulation axis indentified in figref[FIG. 9]
            	. For example, figref[FIG. 9]
            	 identifies a first articulation axis P1 established for the first mounting plate
            
            <b>24</b>

            <b>24</b> (and four of the coupling brackets 
            <b>50</b>), figref[FIG. 9]
            	 identifies corresponding third and fourth articulation axes at P3 and P4. In some
            embodiments, two or more of all of the articulation axes P1-P4 are substantially parallel
            to one another (i.e., within 5 percent of a truly parallel relationship). Further,
            with some end use arrangements, the storage device 
            <b>22</b> is arranged such that the shelf 
            <b>42</b> is spatially horizontal. Under these circumstances, two or more or all of the articulation
            axes P1-P4 are substantially vertical (i.e., extend in the transverse or vertical
            direction Y). Of course, the storage assembly 
            <b>20</b> can be spatially arranged in other orientations that may or may not locate one or
            more of the articulation axes P1-P4 in the vertical direction Y. In some embodiments,
            however, each of the articulation axes P1-P4 are substantially parallel to the major
            plane of the shelf 
            <b>42</b>. Moreover, the snap fit engagement/interface as described above is in the horizontal
            direction X (to support resist a load in the vertical direction Y), and the articulation
            axes P1-P4 are substantially perpendicular to the snap fit engagement direction (i.e.,
            in the vertical direction Y).

            double-faced adhesives 
            <b>26</b> to a corresponding one of the mounting plates 
            <b>24</b>. The second adhesive surface

            flat, the double-faced adhesive 
            <b>26</b> can be thoroughly bonded to the wall by simply pressing the main body 
            <b>40</b> toward the wall. In some installation environments, however, the wall may not be
            substantially flat. For example, in some instances (e.g., a bath or shower enclosure),
            the wall can have a slight curvature and/or have surfaces that are not perfectly aligned
            (e.g., a tiled surface). Under these circumstances, as the main body 
            <b>40</b> is pressed toward the wall, the mounting plates 
            <b>24</b> can or will articulate relative to the corresponding coupling bracket 
            <b>50</b> so that the exposed adhesive surface 
            <b>162</b> of the double-faced adhesive 
            <b>26</b> associated with each of the mounting plates 
            <b>24</b> becomes substantially aligned with the contacted region of the wall surface and maximize
            wet out of the adhesive.

            afford a desired releasable snap fit between the corresponding components, yet facilitate
            articulation or rotation of the mounting plates relative to the storage device. This
