<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/771,162, filed Mar. 1, 2013, incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments herein relate in general to precision control valves, and in particular to valves with a piezoelectric actuator.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Control valves come in a large variety, with many of the control valves being electromagnetic valves having electromagnetic actuators. Major performance disadvantages of these valves are their low special resolution and slow response times. Valves using piezoelectric actuators can also use hydraulic amplifiers installed between the stem and the piezoelectric actuator. Although there are advantages over electromagnetic valves, these valves also have many disadvantages. These disadvantages can include, but are not limited to, (1) a short travel range of no more than 35 microns, which, if expanded using a hydraulic amplifier, complicates the system, reduces the reliability and reduces the accuracy of the system; (2) degradation of the resolution of the system; (3) temperature drift of the hydraulic amplifiers, especially when working in close proximity to internal combustion engines, reducing the resolution of the actuator and compromising the flow control; and (4) increased energy consumption, as the actuator is always on, causing additional linear drift, which also reduces the valve resolution and control range.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The embodiments herein address the problems related to increasing valve control resolution, increasing valve reliability, reducing valve energy consumption, and extending flow control range. These objectives have been achieved with the embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One embodiment of a piezoelectric valve or actuator disclosed herein includes a body with an input passage and an output passage each configured to connect to a fluid flow system, a flow control member movable with respect to the inlet passage and the outlet passage between a fully open position and a closed position and a piezoelectric motor. The piezoelectric motor comprises a piezoelectric resonator in which two orthogonal vibrational modes across a length and a width of the piezoelectric resonator are excited, a working element and one or more contact sites providing frictional contact between the working element and the piezoelectric resonator. One of the working element and the piezoelectric resonator is connected to the flow control member and configured to move relative to the other of the working element and the piezoelectric resonator due to the frictional contact, thereby moving the flow control member. The piezoelectric motor is connected to a control system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Methods of regulating a fluid flow are also disclosed, with one method comprising adjusting a position of a flow control member within a fluid passage by linearly moving the flow control member along a linear axis with a piezoelectric motor having a piezoelectric resonator in frictional contact with a working element Adjusting the position comprises exciting two orthogonal vibrational modes across a length and a width of the piezoelectric resonator, thereby generating movement of one of the working element and the piezoelectric resonator due to the frictional contact and moving the flow control member with the one of the working element and the piezoelectric resonator in which movement is generated.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is described with reference to the attached figures, wherein like reference numerals are used throughout the figures to designate similar or equivalent elements. The figures are not drawn to scale and they are provided merely to illustrate the instant invention. Several aspects of the invention are described below with reference to example applications for illustration. It should be understood that numerous specific details, relationships, and methods are set forth to provide a full understanding of the invention. One having ordinary skill in the relevant art, however, will readily recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods. In other instances, well-known structures or operations are not shown in detail to avoid obscuring the invention. The present invention is not limited by the illustrated ordering of acts or events, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts or events are required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Disclosed herein are linear motion flow control valves that can accurately adjust flow rates to a multitude of values due to nano-scaled linear movement, providing multiple intermediate valve positions throughout the travel range of the valve, by using a single excitation frequency. Examples of specific types of valves are used herein for explanation, but are only provided as examples. The embodiments herein can be used with any linear motion valve known to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to gate valves, globe valves, fixed cone valves, needle valves, pinch valves, diaphragm valves, poppet valves and slide valves.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the various embodiments herein, the control valves are operated with a piezoelectric resonator using one source of alternating voltage at a frequency to excite two modes simultaneously without the need for a special configuration of the excitation electrodes. Thus, a single excitation source combination resonator is provided in the various control valve embodiments. This single source is different from conventional means of providing nano-elliptical motion. Conventionally, such a system of excitation would require excitation of a piezoelectric resonator using two different sources of alternating voltage with equal frequencies, but shifted in phase relative to each other by approximately 90&#xb0; and a special arrangement of electrodes. Such a two-generator excitation system is typically complex and requires that high stability of the phase relationship be maintained, as any unbalance directly affects the basic performance of the motor. This generally imposes additional requirements on the control of the excitation system and increases overall costs.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A piezoelectric control valve is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and has a body <b>1</b> with input and output passages <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> which are configured to connect to an external fluid flow system, such as a piping system through which a fluid flows. A flow control member <b>6</b> is movable across the input and output passages <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, defining the change from the input passage <b>2</b> to the output passage <b>3</b>. A valve seat <b>4</b> is positioned along the input and output passages <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> to receive a distal end <b>5</b> of the flow control member <b>6</b> when the valve is in a closed position, blocking all flow from the inlet passage <b>2</b> to the outlet passage <b>3</b>. In this way, the relative position of flow control member <b>6</b> regulates the quantity of fluid passing through the inlet and outlet passages <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, thus regulating the fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the piezoelectric control valve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that the flow control member <b>6</b> is illustrated as a stem <b>6</b>&#x2032; with a mobile stopper <b>5</b>&#x2032; connected to the stem <b>6</b>&#x2032;. The valve seat <b>4</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> actually includes an opening that allows flow between the input passage <b>2</b> and the output passage <b>3</b>. The valve seat <b>4</b>&#x2032; is configured with a shape that corresponds to the mobile stopper <b>5</b>&#x2032;, receiving the mobile stopper <b>5</b>&#x2032; in a friction fit when the valve is in a fully closed position. In this way, the relative position of mobile stopper <b>5</b>&#x2032; with valve seat <b>4</b>&#x2032; regulates the quantity of fluid passing through the opening of valve seat <b>4</b>&#x2032;, thus regulating the fluid flow. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is provided as a non-limiting example of the different valve types that can be incorporated into the embodiments disclosed herein. Other non-limiting examples include gate valves, globe valves, fixed cone valves, needle valves, pinch valves, diaphragm valves, poppet valves and slide valves.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flow control member <b>6</b> is connected to a linear motor <b>7</b>. The linear motor <b>7</b> includes a housing or body, which can be integral with the valve body <b>1</b> or can be a different adjacent body portion. The linear motor <b>7</b> operates using a piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>. The piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> can be formed of any suitable piezoelectric material. For example, the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> can be formed of barium titanate, or lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT). The linear motor <b>7</b> has a movable working element <b>11</b>, which can be supported by a support structure <b>12</b>. The support structure <b>12</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises bearing rails and is provided as a non-limiting example. The working element <b>11</b> is configured to move linearly along the bearing rails, translating its movement to the flow control member <b>6</b>, thus regulating the flow through the valve. The working element <b>11</b> can be made from a solid material, with steel being a non-limiting example.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The linear movement of the working element <b>11</b> results from the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>, which can be a fixed flat resonator and can work on the principle of combination of excited standing acoustic longitudinal waves and contact with the working element <b>11</b>. The piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> frictionally contacts the working element <b>11</b> at a contact site <b>9</b>. The frictional contact is assisted by a spring <b>10</b>, configured to press the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> against the working element <b>11</b> at the contact site <b>9</b>. As illustrated, the spring <b>10</b> is positioned between a wall of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> and the linear motor <b>7</b>. The spring <b>10</b> is illustrated as a non-limiting example, and other spring-like devices known to those skilled in the art can be used to bias the piezoelectric resonator against the working element <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The piezoelectric valve disclosed herein operates as follows. Excitation of two orthogonal vibrational modes across the length and the width of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> causes motion of the contact site <b>9</b> along a nano-elliptical path. In general, the elliptical paths have amplitudes (i.e. dimensions of the minor and major axes) on the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers and are generally flat with respect to the direction of motion. That is, the major axis of the resulting elliptical paths is generally located in a direction parallel to the direction of motion.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the various embodiments of the present invention, the nano-elliptical motion of the contact site <b>9</b> is formed by a superposition of two standing waves associated with orthogonal vibrational modes of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> such that the points of maximum vibrational velocity correspond with the position of the contact site <b>9</b>&#x2014;that is, the points in the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> in which the standing waves of both of the orthogonal vibrational modes peak. The vibrational modes are excited by providing an excitation voltage via one of a pair of electrodes <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>associated with a lead <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. That is, to provide nano-elliptical paths in a first direction and that provide force to the working element <b>11</b> in a first direction to one of open or close the valve, excitation voltages are provided at electrode <b>8</b><i>a</i>. The electrode <b>8</b><i>a </i>is fabricated from a conductive material, such as silver. To provide similar nano-elliptical paths, but that provide force to the working element <b>11</b> in an opposite direction to the other of open or close the valve, excitation voltages are provided at electrode <b>8</b><i>b</i>. It should be noted that other paths can be generated by the systems herein, including linear paths and paths orthogonal to X and Y axes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> is provided with one or more leads, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as leads <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, to connect to a control system <b>15</b>. The control system <b>15</b> includes a pulse amplifier <b>16</b>, which is connected to a suitable external power supply <b>17</b>. A high frequency generator <b>18</b> produces the excitation resonant frequencies for the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>, and a modulating device <b>19</b> determines the duration and the repetition rate of the group of high frequency pulses, which is connected to the input of the high frequency generator <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A high frequency signal corresponding to the excitation resonance frequencies of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> is generated by high frequency generator <b>18</b>. The high frequency signal is amplified by the pulse amplifier <b>16</b> and the signal is applied to a lead <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>. The piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> is configured with a specific geometry and transverse polarization that causes excitation of two mutually orthogonal longitudinal waves. One frequency can be selected between the two orthogonal vibrational modes, exciting both modes simultaneously. The superposition of the two mutually orthogonal longitudinal waves creates nano-elliptical mechanical movement of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> at the contact site <b>9</b>. Since the contact site <b>9</b> is frictionally conjugated to the working element <b>11</b>, the working element <b>11</b> moves linearly, consequently moving the flow control member <b>6</b> linearly. Accordingly, the distal end <b>5</b> of the flow control member <b>6</b> moves relative to the valve seat <b>4</b>, moving away from the valve seat <b>4</b> to increase the flow through the valve. When the high frequency signal is applied to another of the leads <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, the movement of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> is reversed and the distal end <b>5</b> of the flow control member <b>6</b> moves relative to the valve seat <b>4</b>, moving toward the valve seat <b>4</b> to decrease the flow through the valve.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram of a method of adjusting a flow rate using the control valve embodiments disclosed herein. In step S<b>10</b>, two orthogonal vibrational modes across a length and a width of the piezoelectric resonator are excited. This excitation generates movement of one of the working element and the piezoelectric resonator due to the frictional contact between the two in step S<b>12</b>. If the working element <b>11</b> is fixed, the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> will move, and if the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> is fixed, the working element <b>11</b> will move. The element capable of moving is in turn connected to and moves the flow control member in step S<b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In order to create micro/nano linear movements of the flow control member <b>6</b>, pulses are generated at the output of the modulating device <b>19</b>, the duration of which determines the linear step of the motor. Hence, high linear resolution is achieved by using the linear motor <b>7</b> in stepping mode, which provides high resolution of regulation of the flow.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment of a piezoelectric valve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, more than one working element <b>11</b> is used. The working elements <b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are implemented in the form of plates elastically attached to the body of the linear motor <b>7</b> rather than supported with the support structure <b>12</b>, and rather than the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> being attached to the body. The piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> has one contact site <b>9</b> with each of the working element <b>11</b>. The working elements <b>11</b> are each spring loaded against the respective contact site <b>9</b> of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> with springs <b>10</b>. The spring <b>10</b> is illustrated as a non-limiting example, and other spring-like devices known to those skilled in the art can be used to bias the working elements <b>11</b> against the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>. Accordingly, the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> is mobile relative to the valve housing <b>1</b> and is connected to the flow control member <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In order to achieve straight-line motion of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>, working elements <b>11</b> may be made with longitudinal grooves, along which the contact sites <b>9</b> move. The remaining description of the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is analogous to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment of a piezoelectric valve, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a tubular linear motor <b>7</b>&#x2032; is incorporated. The piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> in this embodiment is polarized radially, i.e. the piezoelectric material forming the resonator is polarized in a direction perpendicular to the inner and outer cylindrical surface of the resonator, or can be polarized axially.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">On an external surface of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> are formed electrodes <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b</i>. The piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> can be situated within a cylindrical working element <b>11</b>. Electrodes <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>are separated by an annular contact site <b>9</b> on the outer surface of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>. The contact site <b>9</b> is located midway along a length of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>. The contact site <b>9</b> can be integrally formed as part of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>. More particularly, the contact site <b>9</b> can be formed as a continuous annular band extending around the outer surface of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>. However, the invention is not limited in this regard and, in other embodiments, the contact site <b>9</b> can be segmented such that the surface of the contact site <b>9</b> is discontinuous around the circumference of the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b>. The contact site <b>9</b> engages with the inner surface of the working element <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The working element <b>11</b> is configured to provide a snug engagement with the contact site <b>9</b>. This can be accomplished by any suitable means. For example, in some embodiments, the working element <b>11</b> can be formed of a spring steel and may include a slit provided along a length of the working element <b>11</b>. The arrangement can be configured so that the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> is retained within the working element <b>11</b> under a spring tension exerted by the working element <b>11</b> itself or from spring-loading the working element <b>11</b> with springs <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> can be snugly fit in the working element <b>11</b> by heating of the working element <b>11</b> during a manufacturing step. With the foregoing arrangement, energy can be directly applied to the working element <b>11</b> when the piezoelectric resonator <b>8</b> is excited and used in the linear motor <b>7</b>&#x2032; configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The remaining description of the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is analogous to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with the exception that the linear motor <b>7</b> runs on a combination of radial and longitudinal modes.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The embodiments of control valves disclosed herein can increase the range of movement of the flow control element of the valve to 10 mm or more, and thus greatly increase the range of adjustment of the flow. The minimum step for movement of the flow control member in this system can be as low as 1 nm, which substantially increases the resolution of the valve. This valve has essentially no drift and does not consume any power while the stem is not moving.</p>
