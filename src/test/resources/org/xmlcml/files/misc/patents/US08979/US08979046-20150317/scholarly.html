      <p>A vacuum suction device of the present invention comprises: a cover which is rotatably
         mounted on the upper portion so as to couple to a flat surface by means of vacuum
         suction; an suction plate, which is coupled to the lower portion of the cover, for
         vacuum suction to the flat surface; and a height adjustment member, which is arranged
         between the cover and the suction plate, for moving the suction plate back and forth
         according to the rotation of the cover; wherein a plurality of fixing pieces are formed
         on the upper surface of the inside of the cover, a plurality of elastic stoppers are
         coupled to the inside of the height adjustment member, so as to be movable by sliding
         when each of the fixing pieces is in contact, and for fixing the cover by each of
         the fixing pieces being hooked to the end portion of the cover so as to prevent reverse
         rotation. The vacuum suction device of the present invention enhances suction force
         so as to couple the vacuum suction device to the flat surface more solidly and for
         a longer time, enhances assembly between each of the elements for vacuum suction,
         and prevents unlocking due to outside shock by forming a double locking structure
         in the vacuum adsorption device.

         <h1>BACKGROUND ART</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, a vacuum suction device is a member which is adhered to a surface by means
            of vacuum suction in order for objects of various shapes such as a towel or toilet
            paper rack to be hung on a flat surface such as a glass or tile surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">The vacuum suction device includes a hanging member and a suction plate, the hanging
            member is formed for a towel or toilet paper rack to be hung on the hanging member,
            and the suction plate is adhered to a smooth surface or a flat surface such as a glass
            or tile surface by means of vacuum suction.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In other words, if the vacuum suction device is, pushed to an adhered surface when
            the suction plate is being brought into contact with a smooth surface or a flat surface,
            that is, the adhered surface, air between the adhered surface and the suction plate
            gets out, and thus, the state of a space between the adhered surface and the suction
            plate is changed to a vacuum-applied state, whereupon the suction plate is sucked
            by the adhered surface, thereby fixing the vacuum suction device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">The suction plate may be adhered to the adhered surface by directly pushing the suction
            plate of the vacuum suction device to the adhered surface, or the suction plate may
            be adhered to the adhered surface by using another member for keeping a sucking state
            of the vacuum suction device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, it is difficult that the vacuum suction device, which directly pushes the suction
            plate to the adhered surface to adhere the suction plate to the adhered surface, seals
            a space between the suction plate and the adhered surface, and suction force of the
            vacuum suction device between the suction plate and the adhered surface is weak. Therefore,
            the suction plate is easily separated from the adhered surface, and thus, it is difficult
            for the vacuum device to be fixed to the adhered surface for a long time, and the
            vacuum suction device separated from the adhered surface has to be repeatedly adhered
            to the adhered surface, and thus, it is inconvenient to use the vacuum suction device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">A vacuum suction device, which adheres a suction plate to an adhered surface by using
            another member, according to Korean Utility Model Registration No 0420964, applied
            and registered by this applicant, includes a cover, a height adjustment member and
            a suction plate, and if the cover is rotated clockwise, a spring is wound and at the
            same time, a height adjustment protrusion formed inside the cover moves along a height-adjustment
            inclined surface, and thus, the cover is lifted by a step height, and at this point,
            if the height adjustment member is inserted into a height-adjustment protrusion fixing
            groove, the spring maintains a wound state.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, a center part of the suction plate is lifted and an outer surface of the
            suction plate is tightly contacting an adhered surface, and thus, a state between
            the adhered surface and the suction plate is changed to a vacuum-applied state, whereupon
            the suction plate is adhered to the adhered surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">Here, the spring always starts at an initial point to make a maximum vacuum suction
            force when vacuum suction is performed, and the height adjustment protrusion is fixed
            to the height-adjustment protrusion fixing groove so as to prevent the spring from
            being unwound.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also, if the height adjustment protrusion is separated from the height-adjustment
            protrusion fixing groove by rotating the cover counterclockwise, the spring is unwound
            by an elastic restoring force of the spring for returning to the initial point, that
            is, an original position, and thus, because a vacuum-applied state between the adhered
            surface and the suction plate is released, the suction plate is separated from the
            adhered surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in the related art vacuum suction device, if the cover is rotated clockwise
            by using an elastic restoring force, the spring is wound, and at the same time, is
            moved to the adhered surface of the suction plate by the height adjustment member,
            and thus, the center part of the suction plate is lifted from the adhered surface
            and a vacuum-applied state is formed, whereupon the suction plate is adhered to the
            adhered surface. If the cover is rotated counterclockwise, the height adjustment protrusion
            is separated from the height-adjustment protrusion fixing groove, the vacuum-applied
            state is released by an elastic restoring force of the spring, the elastic restoring
            force making the spring restored to the initial point, and thus, the suction plate
            is separated from the adhered surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">Because It is very inconvenient to assemble or combine the spring, which effectuates
            the suction plate being adhered to the adhered surface by forming the vacuum-applied
            state between the adhered surface and the suction plate by using the elastic restoring
            force of the spring, or making the suction plate separated from the adhered surface
            by releasing the vacuum-applied state between the adhered surface and the suction
            plate, to the vacuum suction device, a work efficiency is degraded, and because the
            cost of the spring is relatively high, a manufacturing cost increases.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, if the spring is used for a long time, an elastic force is degraded, and
            thus, a performance of the vacuum suction device is degraded, and because the spring,
            an elastic force of which is degraded, has to be replaced after the vacuum suction
            device is disassembled, a replacement is very inconvenient, and a replacement cost
            increases.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">Also, because the cover coupled to the spring has to be rotated several times in the
            course of the initial assembly of every element configuring the vacuum suction device
            so as to generate an elastic force of the spring, unnecessary work has to be added,
            and thus, work efficiency is degraded, and work for combining the cover and the spring
            is inconvenient.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, when the height adjusting protrusion formed in the cover of the vacuum
            suction device moves along a height-adjustment inclined surface of the height adjustment
            member to be inserted into the height-adjustment protrusion fixing groove, and the
            suction plate is adhered to the adhered surface, if the vacuum suction device is given
            an outer shock, the height adjustment protrusion is separated from the height-adjustment
            protrusion fixing groove. At the same time, a rotation of the cover of the vacuum
            suction device to an original position by a restoring force of the spring for returning
            to an original position may occur, and thus, a vacuum-applied state between the adhered
            surface and the suction plated is released, whereupon the suction plate is separated
            from the adhered surface, and thus, the vacuum suction device is so easily separated.

         <h1>ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS</h1>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the embodiments of the present invention, a plurality of fixing pieces
            is formed inside a cover of the vacuum suction device, a plurality of elastic stoppers
            having a certain curved surface is formed in a height adjustment member in order for

            pieces slides and moves along a curved surface of the elastic stopper with each of
            the fixing pieces contacting to the curved surface to be hung on one side surface
            of each of the elastic stoppers when the cover rotates, an outer surface of a suction
            plate of the vacuum suction device tightly contacts a adhered surface, a center part
            of the suction plate is lifted, and a vacuum-applied state is formed between the adhered
            surface and the suction plate, and thus, the suction force of the vacuum suction device
            is enhanced and the suction plate of the vacuum suction device is securely adhered
            to the adhered surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">Moreover, according to the embodiments of the present invention, a spring used in
            a related art vacuum suction device is removed, a plurality of elastic stoppers are
            molded when a height adjustment member is being molded, and thus, the number of components
            configuring the vacuum suction device may decrease, and an assembly of each of elements
            configuring the vacuum suction device may be easily performed, whereupon an assembling
            work between each of the elements configuring the vacuum suction device, a work efficiency
            and productivity may be enhanced, thereby a manufacturing cost of manufacturing the
            vacuum suction device being saved maximally.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also, according to the embodiments of the present invention, each of the elastic stoppers
            is molded to be manufactured integrally with a height adjustment member and protected
            from an outer shock by a cover, and thus, damage and breakage are avoided, thereby
            the vacuum suction device being used semi-permanently.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, according to the embodiments of the present invention, each of the fixing
            pieces formed in the cover of the vacuum suction device moves along the curved surface
            of each of the elastic stoppers to be hung on a bent surface to be fixed, and each
            of stop protrusion parts of the cover moves along an inclined surface formed in a
            side plate of the height adjustment member to be inserted into each of fixing groove
            parts to be hung to form a double lock structure. Therefore, a suction plate of the
            vacuum suction device is solidly adhered to a adhered surface, and thus, the vacuum
            suction device is solidly adhered to the adhered surface, and if the cover of the
            vacuum suction device is not rotated forcibly in an opposite direction, a fixing state
            is not easily released by an outer shock because each element of the double lock structure
            is hung on each other, thereby the suction plate being efficiently prevented from
            being separated from the adhered surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, according to the embodiments of the present invention, if the cover of the
            vacuum suction device is rotated backward forcibly, a double lock structure is released,
            and thus, a function of a conventional spring of automatically returning to an original
            position is maintained.
