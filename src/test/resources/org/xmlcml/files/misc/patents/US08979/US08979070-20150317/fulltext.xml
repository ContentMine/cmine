<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A housing for a dispensing tube of a metering dispenser comprises a mounting half and a strike half carried by the mounting half. A channel for a dispensing tube is defined in the mounting half, and a plunger aperture is defined through the channel. The strike half pivots, relative to the mounting half, between a first pivotal position at least partially covering the channel and a second pivotal position exposing the channel and also slides relative to the mounting half, at least when the strike half is in the first pivotal position, between a first slide position obstructing pivotal movement of the strike half out of the first pivotal position and a second slide position permitting such movement. When the strike half is in the first pivotal position and the first slide position, a plunger strike surface on the strike half is in registration with and facing the plunger aperture.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Solenoid-driven metering systems are well known in the food service arts, and are used for metered dispensing of liquids such as cream and milk, and granular solids such as sugar, for beverages such as coffee and tea. Such systems are sold under the trademark SureShot Dispensing Systems&#xae; by A.C. Dispensing Equipment Inc., having an address at 100 Dispensing Way, Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia, Canada B4C 4H2.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 2B</figref> show an exemplary prior art solenoid-driven metering system <b>10</b>. The metering system <b>10</b> comprises a flexible dispensing tube <b>12</b>, a plastic housing <b>14</b> surrounding a portion of the dispensing tube <b>12</b>, and a solenoid plunger <b>16</b>. Other components of the solenoid-driven metering system, such as the solenoid itself, related control systems, the support structure and other elements have been omitted for clarity of illustration; these elements and their placement will be apparent to one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an upper end <b>12</b>A of the dispensing tube <b>12</b> communicates with a reservoir of the material to be metered (not shown) and a lower end <b>12</b>B communicates with an outlet (not shown), which may simply be an open end of the dispensing tube <b>12</b>. In a typical example, the reservoir is a flexible plastic bag containing milk or cream which is sealed except that it opens into an attached dispensing tube <b>12</b> to allow the milk or cream to be dispensed. The dispensing tube <b>12</b> is arranged generally vertically, with the upper end <b>12</b>A above the lower end <b>12</b>B, so that material will flow downwardly through the tube from the upper end <b>12</b>A to the lower end <b>12</b>B under the influence of gravity, unless the dispensing tube <b>12</b> is constricted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The housing <b>14</b> comprises two opposed halves <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B removably hingedly secured to one another in a clamshell arrangement by a hinge <b>18</b> and securable around the dispensing tube <b>12</b> in a closed configuration. Two opposed channels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B defined in the tube-receiving faces of the two opposed halves <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B cooperate to define a vertical passageway <b>20</b> through the housing <b>14</b> for the dispensing tube <b>12</b>. The half <b>14</b>A of the housing <b>14</b> facing the solenoid plunger <b>16</b> has a plunger aperture <b>22</b> which exposes the dispensing tube <b>12</b>. The housing <b>14</b> is maintained in the closed configuration by a thumbscrew <b>19</b> that is rotatably journalled in a bore (not shown) through the half <b>14</b>B of the housing <b>14</b> that does not face the solenoid plunger <b>16</b> and is threadedly received in a correspondingly positioned threaded aperture <b>21</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the half <b>14</b>A facing the solenoid plunger <b>16</b>. The threaded aperture <b>21</b> is formed in a metal insert <b>23</b> which is in turn secured in a larger aperture in the half <b>14</b>A facing the solenoid plunger <b>16</b>, so as to provide improved strength relative to the plastic from which the housing <b>14</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typically, a temperature sensor insert <b>17</b> formed from aluminum is installed in the channel <b>20</b>A in the half <b>14</b>A facing the solenoid plunger <b>16</b>. The insert <b>17</b> carries a temperature sensor such as a thermistor (not shown) and engages the dispensing tube <b>12</b> so that the insert <b>17</b> will assume the approximate temperature of the material in the dispensing tube <b>12</b> and allow this temperature to be detected by the temperature sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The solenoid plunger <b>16</b> comprises a solenoid-actuable armature shaft <b>24</b> and a plunger head <b>26</b> secured to one end of the armature shaft <b>24</b>. The plunger head <b>26</b> is formed from plastic and comprises a base <b>28</b> secured to the armature shaft <b>24</b>, four support members <b>30</b>, a disc-shaped portion <b>32</b> and a closure member <b>34</b>. The support members <b>30</b> are ogee-shaped and arranged in cruciform relation to one another, and extend outwardly from the base <b>28</b> to support the disc-shaped portion <b>30</b>, which in turn supports the closure member <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When assembled, the plunger aperture <b>22</b> in the half <b>14</b>A of the housing <b>14</b> facing the solenoid plunger <b>16</b> is in registration with the closure member <b>34</b> on the plunger head <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In operation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the solenoid plunger <b>16</b> is arranged for reciprocal motion toward and away from the housing <b>14</b> under the control of the solenoid (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The &#x201c;resting&#x201d; or &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position of the solenoid plunger <b>16</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>; in this position the closure member <b>34</b> on the plunger head <b>26</b> has been received in the plunger aperture <b>22</b> in the half <b>14</b>A of the housing <b>14</b> facing the solenoid plunger <b>16</b>, and the plunger <b>16</b> may be maintained in this position by, for example, a suitable biasing member such as a spring (not shown). In this position, the closure member <b>34</b> compresses the dispensing tube <b>12</b> and pinches it against the back wall <b>36</b> of the passageway <b>20</b> defined by the channels <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the two halves <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B of the housing <b>14</b>. This pinching of the dispensing tube <b>12</b> substantially completely obstructs the dispensing tube <b>12</b>, inhibiting material flow past the closure member <b>34</b>. Typically, the half <b>14</b>B opposite the half <b>14</b>A having the plunger aperture <b>22</b> includes a strike plate (not shown) for the plunger, typically formed from aluminum, that is integrated into the back wall <b>36</b> of the passageway to be in registration with the plunger aperture <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When it is desired to dispense material, the solenoid (not shown) is actuated to move the solenoid plunger <b>16</b> into the &#x201c;active&#x201d; or &#x201c;open&#x201d; position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, for a fixed period of time before disengaging the solenoid and allowing the solenoid plunger <b>16</b> to return to the &#x201c;rest&#x201d; or &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. During the period of time that the solenoid plunger <b>16</b> is in the &#x201c;active&#x201d; or &#x201c;open&#x201d; position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), the dispensing tube <b>12</b> is unobstructed and a predetermined volume of liquid or granular material is able to move past the position of the solenoid plunger <b>16</b> before the dispensing tube <b>12</b> is again obstructed as the solenoid plunger <b>16</b> returns to the &#x201c;rest&#x201d; or &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The plunger head <b>26</b> is secured to the armature shaft <b>24</b> by way of a tab <b>38</b> extending from the base <b>28</b> of the plunger head <b>26</b> and which is received in a corresponding slot <b>40</b> at the end of the armature shaft <b>24</b> and held in place by a rivet <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When a reservoir of the material being metered, such as a bag of cream or milk, is empty and must be replaced, a user will unscrew the thumbscrew <b>19</b> and then separate the two opposed halves <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B by pivoting the half <b>14</b>B having the thumbscrew <b>19</b> away from the other half <b>14</b>A, which is mounted to the dispenser, so as to expose the dispensing tube <b>12</b>. This enables the user to remove the empty bag and its associated dispensing tube <b>12</b> and install a new, full bag and insert the associated new dispensing tube <b>12</b> into the channel <b>20</b>A. The user then pivots the half <b>14</b>B having the thumbscrew <b>19</b> back toward the other half <b>14</b>A, trapping the new dispensing tube <b>12</b> in the vertical passageway <b>20</b>, and then screws the thumbscrew <b>19</b> back into the threaded aperture <b>21</b>. This procedure is time consuming, especially in the context of a quick-service restaurant, where seconds count and customers expect to be served in less than a minute. Moreover, with repeated use, the thumbscrew <b>19</b> may develop a tendency to bind in the threaded aperture <b>21</b>, making it more difficult to screw and unscrew and thereby increasing both the difficulty of changing the reservoir as well as the time required to do so.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the barrel portions <b>18</b>B of the plastic hinge <b>18</b> joining the two halves <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B are prone to breakage, as shown by the arrow &#x201c;B&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Such breakage requires that the entire housing <b>14</b> be replaced, necessitating a costly maintenance call and also requiring that the metering dispenser be taken out of service.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A housing for a dispensing tube of a metering dispenser comprises a mounting half for mounting the housing to a metering dispenser and a strike half for receiving plunger strikes. The strike half is carried by the mounting half. The mounting half has a mounting half tube channel defined therein for receiving a dispensing tube and also has a mounting half tube channel for receiving a plunger, and the strike half has a plunger strike surface. The strike half is pivotally carried by the mounting half so as to be pivotable, relative to the mounting half, between a first pivotal position in which the strike half at least partially covers the mounting half tube channel and a second pivotal position in which the strike half exposes the mounting half tube channel. The strike half is further slidably carried by the mounting half so as to be slidable relative to the mounting half, at least when the strike half is in the first pivotal position, between a first slide position in which pivotal movement of the strike half relative to the mounting half from the first pivotal position toward the second pivotal position is obstructed, and a second slide position in which pivotal movement of the strike half relative to the mounting half from the first pivotal position to the second pivotal position is permitted. At least when the strike half is in the first pivotal position and in the first slide position, the plunger strike surface is in registration with and facing the plunger aperture to receive a plunger head.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the strike half is hingedly carried by the mounting half by way of a pivot extending between the mounting half and the strike half and on which the strike half is rotatably received so as to be rotatable about the pivot between the first pivotal position and the second pivotal position, and the strike half is further slidable along the pivot, at least when the strike half is in the first pivotal position, between the first slide position and the second slide position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain embodiments, one of the mounting half and the strike half has at least one locking finger and the other one of the mounting half and the strike half has at least one latch arm extending therefrom, with each latch arm forming a receiving slot for receiving a respective locking finger. When the strike half is in the first pivotal position and the first slide position, each locking finger is in registration with its respective latch arm, inside the receiving slot formed by the respective latch arm, so that each latch arm engages its respective locking finger to obstruct movement of the strike half from the first pivotal position toward the second pivotal position. When the strike half is in the first pivotal position and the second slide position, each locking finger is out of registration with its respective latch arm and outside of the receiving slot formed by the respective latch arm whereby movement of the strike half from the first pivotal position toward the second pivotal position is permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular embodiments, the at least one locking finger comprises a plurality of locking fingers spaced longitudinally apart from one another to define a locking finger gap between each adjacent pair of locking fingers, and the at least one latch arm comprises a plurality of latch arms spaced longitudinally apart from one another to define a latch arm gap between each adjacent pair of latch arms. When the strike half moves between the first pivotal position and the second pivotal position while in the second slide position, at least one latch arm fits in a corresponding locking finger gap, and at least one locking finger fits in a corresponding locking arm gap.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The locking finger(s) or the latch arm(s), or both, may each have a tapered guide surface for guiding the strike half into the second slide position as the strike half moves into the first pivotal position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the strike half has a strike half tube channel defined therein, and the strike half tube channel cooperates with the mounting half tube channel, when the strike half is in the first pivotal position, to form a dispensing tube channel.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which shows an exemplary housing <b>300</b> for a dispensing tube of a metering dispenser (not shown). The housing <b>300</b> comprises a mounting half <b>302</b> for mounting the housing <b>300</b> to a metering dispenser and a strike half <b>304</b> for receiving plunger strikes, with the strike half <b>304</b> being carried by the mounting half <b>302</b>. The use of the terms &#x201c;mounting half&#x201d; and &#x201c;strike half&#x201d; refer to the clamshell structure of the housings described herein, and is not intended to imply that the mounting half and strike half are, or need be of equal size or identical shape. Indeed, as will be apparent from the drawings, in the exemplary illustrated embodiment the mounting half <b>302</b> has a substantially larger footprint than the strike half <b>304</b>. Both the mounting half <b>302</b> and the strike half <b>304</b> are preferably monolithic and are preferably formed from metal of suitable strength, more preferably from aluminum, and most preferably from anodized aluminum. Other materials, such as plastic of suitable strength, may also be used. The mounting half <b>302</b> and the strike half <b>304</b> may be made of different materials.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The strike half <b>304</b> can move relative to the mounting half <b>302</b> so that the housing <b>300</b> has a closed and locked configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to <b>16</b>), a closed and unlocked configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>), and at least one open configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). To enable the housing <b>300</b> to be placed into the various configurations, the strike half <b>304</b> is both pivotally and slidably carried by the mounting half <b>302</b>, as described in greater detail below. The mounting half <b>302</b> and the strike half <b>304</b> each have respective tube-receiving <b>302</b>A, <b>304</b>A and outer faces <b>302</b>B, <b>304</b>B. The outer face <b>302</b>B of the mounting half may be mounted to a metering dispenser, and when the housing <b>300</b> is in the closed and locked configuration and in the closed and unlocked configuration, the tube-receiving faces <b>302</b>A, <b>304</b>A face one another.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, in the illustrated embodiment the mounting half <b>302</b> has a mounting half tube channel <b>306</b> defined in its tube-receiving face <b>302</b>A for receiving a flexible dispensing tube <b>308</b> of the metering dispenser, and a plunger aperture <b>310</b> is defined through the mounting half <b>302</b>, and in particular through the mounting half tube channel <b>306</b>, for receiving a plunger <b>380</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>). The strike half <b>304</b> has a strike half tube channel <b>312</b> defined in its tube-receiving face <b>304</b>A, and has a plunger strike surface <b>314</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) on the tube-receiving face <b>304</b>A interrupting the strike half tube channel <b>312</b>. In the illustrated embodiment in which the mounting half <b>302</b> and the strike half <b>304</b> are made from metal, in particular anodized aluminum, the plunger strike surface <b>314</b> is preferably integral with the monolithic strike half <b>304</b>; in embodiments where the strike half <b>304</b> is formed from a material not suitable for withstanding direct plunger strikes, a separate plunger strike plate may provide the plunger strike surface. While the exemplary embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 16</figref> shows the plunger strike surface <b>314</b> as a recessed part the tube-receiving face <b>304</b>A, in other embodiments the plunger strike surface may be coplanar with the remainder of the tube-receiving face aside from the strike half tube channel.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At least when the housing <b>300</b> is in the closed and locked configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to <b>16</b>) the strike half <b>302</b> partially covers the mounting half <b>302</b> so as to obstruct access to the mounting half tube channel <b>306</b>, and the strike half tube channel <b>312</b> cooperates with the mounting half tube channel <b>306</b> to form a dispensing tube passage <b>316</b> through the housing <b>300</b>. The dispensing tube passage <b>316</b> receives the dispensing tube <b>308</b> of the metering dispenser and positions the dispensing tube <b>308</b> for engagement by a plunger of the metering dispenser. Moreover, at least when the housing <b>300</b> is in the closed and locked configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to <b>16</b>) the plunger strike surface <b>314</b> is in registration with the plunger aperture <b>310</b> to receive a plunger head.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other embodiments, the strike half may omit any strike half tube channel, and the mounting half tube channel may be correspondingly deeper, so that the entire dispensing tube can be accommodated within the mounting half tube channel.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As noted above, the strike half <b>304</b> is both pivotally and slidably carried by the mounting half <b>302</b>. The strike half <b>304</b> is pivotally carried by the mounting half <b>302</b> so as to be pivotable, relative to the mounting half <b>302</b>, between a first pivotal position in which the strike half <b>304</b> at least partially covers the mounting half tube channel <b>306</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> to <b>16</b>); and a second pivotal position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) in which the strike half <b>304</b> exposes the mounting half tube channel <b>306</b>. The strike half <b>304</b> is further slidably carried by the mounting half <b>302</b> so that, at least when the strike half <b>304</b> is in the first pivotal position, the strike half <b>304</b> is slidable, relative to the mounting half <b>302</b>, between a first slide position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to <b>16</b>) and a second slide position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>). When the strike half <b>304</b> is in the first slide position and is also in the first pivotal position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to <b>16</b>), pivotal movement of the strike half <b>304</b>, relative to the mounting half <b>302</b>, from the first pivotal position toward the second pivotal position is obstructed. When the strike half <b>304</b> is in the second slide position, pivotal movement of the strike half <b>304</b> relative to the mounting half <b>302</b> from the first pivotal position to the second pivotal position is permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The angular distance between the second pivotal position and the first pivotal position of the strike half <b>304</b> relative to the mounting half <b>302</b> should be such that the strike half <b>304</b> exposes the mounting half tube channel <b>306</b> and hence the dispensing tube <b>308</b>. As shown in solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the illustrated embodiment an angular distance of about 90 degrees from the first pivotal position is sufficient for the strike half <b>304</b> to expose the mounting half tube channel <b>306</b> and the dispensing tube <b>308</b>. However, in the illustrated embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 16</figref>, the second pivotal position of the strike half <b>304</b> relative to the mounting half <b>302</b>, shown with broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, has an angular distance slightly greater than 180 degrees from the first pivotal position. This provides greater access to the mounting half tube channel <b>306</b> for removal of an old dispensing tube <b>308</b> and installation of a new dispensing tube <b>308</b>. The second pivotal position shown with broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a limit position defined by engagement of the pivot-side sidewall <b>324</b> of the strike half <b>304</b> with the pivot side sidewall <b>326</b> of the mounting half <b>302</b>. Alternately, if it is desired to define the second pivotal position at a lesser angular distance from the first pivotal position, such as about 90 degrees as shown in solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a suitable stop can be provided on one or more of the mounting half <b>302</b>, the strike half <b>304</b> or the metering dispenser itself adjacent the housing <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 16</figref>, the strike half <b>304</b> is hingedly carried by the mounting half <b>302</b> by way of a pivot <b>328</b> extending between the mounting half <b>302</b> and the strike half <b>304</b> and on which the strike half <b>304</b> is rotatably received so as to be rotatable about the pivot <b>328</b> between the first pivotal position and the second pivotal position. In particular, the pivot <b>328</b> is a cylindrical rod carried at its ends by two opposed pivot carriers <b>330</b> extending from the tube-receiving face <b>302</b>A of the mounting half <b>302</b> adjacent the pivot-side sidewall <b>326</b> of the mounting half <b>302</b>, and the pivot <b>328</b> is rotatably received in a barrel <b>332</b> extending from the pivot-side sidewall <b>324</b> of the strike half <b>304</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, the barrel <b>332</b> is shorter in length than the distance between the facing edges <b>334</b> of the pivot carriers <b>330</b>, that is, the edges <b>334</b> of the pivot carriers <b>330</b> that face one another. This enables the barrel <b>332</b>, and hence the strike half <b>304</b>, to slide along the pivot <b>328</b> between the facing edges <b>334</b> of the pivot carriers <b>330</b>, which act as stops to limit the movement of the barrel <b>332</b> and strike half <b>304</b> and thereby define the first slide position and the second slide position.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the illustrated embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 16</figref>, pivotal movement of the strike half <b>304</b> relative to the mounting half <b>302</b> is independent of sliding movement of the strike half <b>304</b> relative to the mounting half <b>302</b>. In other words, the strike half <b>304</b> can slide relative to the mounting half <b>302</b> without pivoting relative to the mounting half <b>302</b>, and the strike half <b>304</b> can pivot relative to the mounting half <b>302</b> without sliding relative to the mounting half <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref> to <b>10</b>, in the particular exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 16</figref>, the strike half <b>304</b> has a plurality of locking fingers <b>336</b> extending from the distal sidewall <b>338</b> of the strike half <b>304</b>, that is, the sidewall <b>338</b> that is distal from the pivot-side sidewall <b>324</b> of the strike half <b>304</b>. The locking fingers <b>336</b> are longitudinally spaced apart from one another along the distal sidewall <b>338</b> of the strike half <b>304</b> so as to define locking finger gaps <b>340</b> between each adjacent pair of locking fingers <b>336</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;longitudinally&#x201d; refers to the sliding motion of the strike half <b>304</b> relative to the mounting half <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The mounting half <b>302</b> has a plurality of latch arms <b>342</b> extending from the tube-receiving face <b>302</b>A of the mounting half <b>302</b>, adjacent the distal sidewall <b>344</b> thereof, that is, the sidewall <b>344</b> distal from the pivot-side sidewall <b>326</b> of the mounting half <b>302</b>. Similarly to the locking fingers <b>336</b>, the latch arms <b>342</b> are spaced longitudinally apart from one another so as to define latch arm gaps <b>346</b> between each adjacent pair of latch arms <b>342</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the latch arms <b>342</b> are each generally L-shaped and comprise a spacer portion <b>348</b> extending from the tube-receiving face <b>302</b>A of the mounting half <b>302</b> and a retaining portion <b>350</b> extending from the outer end of the spacer portion <b>348</b> toward the pivot-side sidewall <b>326</b> of the mounting half <b>302</b>. Each latch arm <b>342</b> thereby forms a receiving slot <b>352</b> between the retaining portion <b>350</b> and the tube-receiving face <b>302</b>A of the mounting half <b>302</b> for receiving a respective locking finger <b>336</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>14</b>, when the strike half <b>304</b> is in the first pivotal position and the first slide position, each locking finger <b>336</b> is in registration with its respective latch arm <b>342</b>, inside the receiving slot <b>352</b> formed by the respective latch arm <b>342</b>. This is the closed and locked configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to <b>16</b>), and in this configuration each latch arm <b>342</b>, in particular the retaining portion <b>350</b> thereof, engages its respective locking finger <b>336</b> to obstruct movement of the strike half <b>304</b> from the first pivotal position toward the second pivotal position. Conversely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 13</figref>, when the strike half <b>304</b> is in the first pivotal position and the second slide position, each locking finger <b>336</b> is out of registration with its respective latch arm <b>342</b>, and hence outside of the receiving slot <b>352</b> formed by the respective latch arm <b>342</b>. This is the closed and unlocked configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>). In this closed and unlocked configuration, the retaining portions <b>350</b> of the latch arms <b>342</b> do not engage the respective locking fingers <b>336</b>, and therefore movement of the strike half <b>304</b> from the first pivotal position toward the second pivotal position is permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As can be seen by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, when the strike half <b>304</b> moves between the first pivotal position and the second pivotal position while in the second slide position, each of the upper three latch arms <b>342</b> fits in a corresponding locking finger gap <b>340</b>, and each of the lower three locking fingers fits in a corresponding latch arm gap <b>346</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the underside of each of the locking fingers <b>336</b> forms a tapered guide surface <b>354</b> that slopes generally upwardly toward the tube-receiving face <b>304</b>A of the strike half <b>304</b>. As the strike half <b>304</b> moves into the first pivotal position, it may be not be precisely in the second slide position, i.e. the strike half <b>304</b> may be slightly lower than the second slide position, so that the locking fingers <b>336</b> are not in registration with the latch arm gaps <b>346</b>. In this case, the tapered guide surfaces <b>354</b> will engage the retaining portions <b>350</b> of the corresponding latch arms <b>342</b> and guide the strike half <b>304</b> upwardly into the second slide position as the strike half <b>304</b> moves into the first pivotal position.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Instead of providing tapered guide surfaces on the undersides of the locking fingers, or in addition thereto, the upper surfaces of the retaining portions may comprise tapered guide surfaces sloping upwardly toward the tube-receiving face <b>302</b>A of the mounting half <b>302</b>. Similarly, in alternate embodiments the strike half may have the latch arms and the mounting half may have the locking fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">To facilitate locking and unlocking of the housing <b>300</b>, the strike half <b>304</b> should be slidable along the pivot <b>328</b> between the first slide position and the second slide position at least when the strike half <b>304</b> is in the first pivotal position. In the illustrated embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 16</figref>, the strike half <b>304</b> is slidable along the pivot <b>328</b> between the first slide position and the second slide position at any pivotal position of the strike half <b>304</b> relative to the mounting half <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It is contemplated that in other embodiments (not shown), the strike half may only be able to slide between the first and second slide positions when the strike half is in or nearly in the first pivotal position. In one exemplary implementation, the pivot carrier that is lowermost when the housing is in an upright position may include a projecting portion extending toward the barrel to define a partial shoulder, and the end of the barrel closest to that pivot carrier may include a corresponding recess. In such an implementation, sliding of the barrel, and hence the strike half, would only be permitted when the projecting portion and recess were in registration with one another; when the projecting portion and recess were out of registration the shoulder on the projecting portion would engage the non-recessed part of the end of the barrel to prevent sliding of the barrel along the pivot and thereby prevent any substantial sliding of the strike half relative to the mounting half. Accordingly, by arranging the projecting portion and recess so that they will only be in registration when the strike half is in or nearly in the first pivotal position, the projecting portion will engage the end of the barrel to maintain the strike half in the second slide position unless the strike half is in or nearly in the first pivotal position. When the strike half is in or nearly in the first pivotal position, the projecting portion and recess will be in registration so that the projecting portion on the lowermost pivot carrier is received in the recess as the barrel slides toward that pivot carrier to enable the strike half to slide from the second slide position to the first slide position. Such an arrangement could also be constructed to prevent or inhibit the access portion from pivoting from the first pivotal position to the second pivotal position unless the access portion were in the second slide position, by arranging the projecting portion and the recess so that a side of the projecting portion would engage a side of the recess so as to block pivoting unless the access portion is in the second slide position.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Operation of a metering dispenser incorporating a housing as described herein, such as the housing <b>300</b>, is similar to operation of a metering dispenser incorporating the prior art housing <b>14</b>. Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, which show the exemplary housing <b>300</b> in the closed and locked configuration with a dispensing tube <b>308</b> installed therein together with a solenoid plunger <b>380</b>. The exemplary solenoid plunger <b>380</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> is of the type shown and described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/880,016, to which the present application claims priority (published as US2012/0061599A1) and corresponding Canadian Patent Application No. 2714916, the teachings of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference. As with the illustration of the prior art housing <b>14</b> and prior art solenoid plunger <b>16</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> the other components of the metering dispenser, such as the solenoid itself, related control systems, the support structure and other elements, have been omitted for clarity of illustration as these elements and their placement will be apparent to one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows solenoid plunger <b>380</b> in the &#x201c;resting&#x201d; or &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position, in which the closure member <b>382</b> on the plunger head <b>384</b> is received in the plunger aperture <b>310</b> in the mounting half <b>302</b> of the housing <b>300</b>, compressing the dispensing tube <b>308</b> and pinching it against the plunger strike surface <b>314</b>, thereby inhibiting material flow past the closure member <b>382</b>. The solenoid plunger <b>380</b> may be maintained in this position by, for example, a suitable biasing member such as a spring (not shown). To dispense material, the solenoid (not shown) is actuated to move the solenoid plunger <b>380</b> into the &#x201c;active&#x201d; or &#x201c;open&#x201d; position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, for a fixed period of time before disengaging the solenoid and allowing the solenoid plunger <b>380</b> to return to the &#x201c;rest&#x201d; or &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. While the solenoid plunger <b>380</b> is in the &#x201c;active&#x201d; or &#x201c;open&#x201d; position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), the dispensing tube <b>308</b> is unobstructed, enabling a predetermined volume of liquid or granular material to move past the position of the solenoid plunger <b>380</b> before the solenoid plunger <b>380</b> returns to the &#x201c;rest&#x201d; or &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), again obstructing the dispensing tube <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the reservoir is empty and must be replaced, the user first moves the strike half <b>304</b> from the closed and locked configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to <b>16</b>) to the closed and unlocked configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>) by sliding the strike half <b>304</b> upwardly along the pivot <b>328</b> from the first slide position to the second slide position. With the strike half <b>304</b> in the second slide position, the user pivots the strike half <b>304</b> from the first pivotal position through the intermediate pivotal position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to the second pivotal position, thereby placing the housing <b>300</b> in an open configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). This enables the dispensing tube <b>308</b> of the empty reservoir to be replaced with the dispensing tube <b>308</b> of the new reservoir. When the housing <b>300</b> is installed, the strike half <b>304</b> will be biased toward the first slide position by gravity, especially when it is made of metal and can slide smoothly along the pivot <b>328</b>. At any time after the locking fingers <b>336</b> are clear of the latch arms <b>342</b>, the user can allow the strike half <b>304</b> to slide under gravity from the second slide position to the first slide position, or alternatively can hold the strike half <b>304</b> in the second slide position while replacing the dispensing tube <b>308</b>. Once the reservoir and flexible dispensing tube <b>308</b> have been replaced, the user then pivots the strike half <b>304</b> from the second pivotal position through the intermediate pivotal position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> toward the first pivotal position and, if the user has not held the strike half <b>304</b> in the second slide position, slides the strike half <b>304</b> into the second slide position. This enables the upper three latch arms <b>342</b> to enter the corresponding locking finger gaps <b>340</b> while the lower three locking fingers <b>336</b> enter the corresponding latch arm gaps <b>346</b>. Thus, when the strike half <b>304</b> reaches the first pivotal position, the strike half <b>304</b> will be in the second slide position and therefore in the closed and unlocked configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>). The user can then either manually move the strike half <b>304</b> into the first slide position or, where the strike half is heavy enough and can slide smoothly along the pivot <b>328</b>, the user can simple release the strike half <b>304</b> and allow it to fall into the first slide position under gravity, in either case returning the housing to closed and locked configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to <b>16</b>). To enable the strike half <b>304</b> to fall into the first slide position under gravity to transition from the closed and unlocked configuration to the closed and locked configuration, the clearance between the locking fingers <b>336</b> and the receiving slots <b>352</b> formed by the latch arms should be sufficient to enable the strike half <b>304</b> to fall smoothly into place. The strike half <b>304</b> includes an upper grip recess <b>388</b> in its outer face <b>304</b>B and a lower grip recess <b>390</b> defined in the lower edge of the strike half <b>304</b> to assist a user in grasping and moving the strike half <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a pair of mounting bores <b>356</b> are defined through the mounting half <b>302</b> on either side of the mounting half tube channel <b>306</b>. The mounting bores <b>356</b> each include an intermediate annular shoulder <b>358</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and can receive a bolt (not shown) for securing the mounting half <b>302</b> to a metering dispenser, as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A temperature sensor aperture <b>360</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is also defined through the mounting half <b>302</b>, in the mounting half tube channel <b>306</b> above the plunger aperture <b>310</b>, for receiving a thermistor <b>362</b> or other temperature sensor. Where the mounting half <b>304</b> is made from aluminum or another suitable material having good thermal conductivity, the need for an insert made from such material is obviated.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a closure sensor aperture <b>364</b> is defined through the mounting half <b>302</b> for receiving a closure sensor, such as the illustrated reed switch <b>366</b> which detects a rare earth magnet (not shown) held by a bolt or screw <b>370</b> in a correspondingly positioned magnet aperture <b>368</b> defined in the tube receiving face <b>304</b>A of the strike half <b>304</b>. The closure sensor aperture <b>364</b> and the closure sensor <b>366</b> may be positioned on either side of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Certain currently preferred embodiments have been described by way of example. It will be apparent to persons skilled in the art that a number of variations and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the claims.
