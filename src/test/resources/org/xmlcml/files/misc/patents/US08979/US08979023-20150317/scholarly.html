         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aerial vehicles such as unmanned aerial vehicles can be used for performing conveyance,
            delivery, surveillance, reconnaissance, and exploration tasks for military and civilian
            applications. Such vehicles typically include a propulsion system for remote controlled
            and/or autonomous movement with the surrounding environment. For example, an aerial
            vehicle may be propelled through the air via a propulsion system, and may be capable
            of take-off and landing, flight, and hovering.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">When an aerial vehicle malfunctions in mid-air it will fall. This can cause damage
            to the aerial vehicle, as well as any payloads or passengers.

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">A need exists for improved systems, methods, and devices for protecting movable objects
            such as aerial vehicles. The present invention provides systems, methods, and devices
            for airbags that may assist with protecting an aerial vehicle, such as an unmanned
            aerial vehicle, if the aerial vehicle were to fall during flight. In some embodiments,
            the systems, methods, and devices described herein provide an airbag that can be inflated
            using compressed gas. An aerial vehicle control mechanism can control a gas valve
            that controls whether gas will flow into the airbag, causing it to inflate. The control
            mechanism may be powered by a power supply that is independent of a power source powering
            other portions of the aerial vehicle.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aspect of the invention is directed to an impact protection apparatus for an aerial
            vehicle, the apparatus comprising: an inflatable member configured to be coupled to
            the aerial vehicle and inflatable to reduce forces experienced by the aerial vehicle
            during an impact; a container coupled to the inflatable member, said container comprising
            compressed gas; and a control mechanism powered by a power source separate from that
            providing power to the aerial vehicle, wherein the control mechanism is configured
            to cause the compressed gas to flow from the container into the inflatable member
            in response to a signal indicative of malfunction of the aerial vehicle.

         <p id="p-0040" num="0039">The system, devices, and method of the present invention provide improved impact reduction
            mechanisms for movable objects, such as an aerial vehicle (e.g., an unmanned aerial
            vehicle (UAV)). In some embodiments, one or more airbags may be provided that may
            be inflatable to reduce forces on an aerial vehicle during impact. The airbags may
            be inflated using a compressed gas. Advantageously, inflating airbags using compressed
            gas is a more cost-effective method than using airbags that inflate using a chemical
            reaction. The airbag may reduce the forces of impact that may be experienced by the
            movable object, such as the aerial vehicle.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0041" num="0040">The aerial vehicle may have one or more compressed gas container mounted thereon.
            A gas valve may be provided that may control whether the compressed gas flows from
            the container into the airbag. The gas valve may be controlled using a valve controller.
            The valve and/or controller may be powered by a power source independent of the rest
            of the aerial vehicle. This may advantageously permit an airbag to deploy even if
            the rest of the aerial vehicle has lost power. This may be particularly useful, as
            an aircraft losing power may be a situation in which an impact is likely to occur.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">The valve controller may include one or more sensors or receive data from one or more
            other sensors or controllers. The valve controller may use this data to determine
            whether to send a trigger signal to the valve to open the gas flow from the container
            to the airbag. The sensors may be indicative of conditions such as free fall, unusual
            acceleration, unusual velocity, unusual orientation proximate surfaces or objects,
            overheating, power loss, guidance/navigation or communication failure, flight control
            failure, instructions from an external device such as a remote terminal, or any other
            conditions. Such conditions may be indicative of a malfunction, in which case it may
            be desirable to deploy an airbag.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, a safety mechanism may be provided. The safety mechanism may
            be in place so that the airbag is prevented from deploying unless the safety mechanism
            is deactivated. This may advantageously prevent the airbag from deploying prematurely.
            For example, this may prevent an airbag from deploying and potentially injuring a
            user when a user is carrying a UAV. The safety mechanism may be deactivated manually
            by a user, or may be deactivated automatically when the aerial vehicle takes flight.
            In one example, the safety mechanism may be a pin that prevents the deployment of
            the airbag unless the pin is pulled out.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0044" num="0043">Various configurations of airbags may be provided. For example, an aerial vehicle
            may have one or more airbags below and/or above the aerial vehicle. The airbags may
            be distributed along any portion of the aerial vehicle, such as the aerial vehicle
            body, propulsion units, arms, control systems, communication interfaces, carrier,
            payload, passengers, landing gear, or any other portion.

            protection apparatus may include a container 
            <b>110</b> configured to enclose compressed gas, a gas valve 
            <b>120</b>, and an inflatable member 
            <b>130</b>. The gas valve may control flow of the gas from the container to the inflatable member.
            A controller

         <p id="p-0046" num="0045">When an aerial vehicle experiences a malfunction, the inflatable member needs to be
            rapidly inflated with gas. A compressed gas technique may be used. The gas container
            
            <b>110</b> may be configured to contain a compressed gas. In some embodiments, the compressed
            gas may be carbon dioxide (CO
            <sub>2</sub>). Other examples of compressed gases that may be used may include nitrogen. However,
            carbon dioxide may be a preferable gas as it is low cost, safe/not combustible, when
            becoming gas will not absorb too much heat like some other options. The container
            may be able to contain a gas that is provided at a high pressure. For example, the
            gas container may be capable of storing compressed gas that is greater than or equal
            to about 25 psi, 30 psi, 40 psi, 50 psi, 60 psi, 70 psi, 80 psi, 100 psi, 110 psi,
            120 psi, 130 psi, 140 psi, 150 psi, 160 psi, 170 psi, 180 psi, 190 psi, 200 psi, 220

            psi, or 5000 psi. In some embodiments, the gas container may be capable of storing
            compressed gas having a pressure that does not exceed 70 psi, 80 psi, 100 psi, 110
            psi, 120 psi, 130 psi, 140 psi, 150 psi, 160 psi, 170 psi, 180 psi, 190 psi, 200 psi,

            3000 psi, 4000 psi, 5000 psi, 6000 psi, 7000 psi, or 7500 psi. The gas container may
            be storing a compressed gas having a maximum pressure that falls between any of the
            pressure values mentioned herein. In some embodiments, the gas container pressure
            may fall within 0.2×10
            <sup>6 </sup>Pa and 50×10
            <sup>6 </sup>Pa.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0047" num="0046">A compressed gas container may be formed from any material known in the art, such
            as those capable of storing gas at the pressures mentioned above. Some examples of
            materials may include carbon steel, stainless steel or aluminium alloy. In some instances,
            plastics or polymers may be used to form the gas container. For example, if the pressure
            within the container is not too high, even a plastic soda bottle may be sufficient.

         <p id="p-0048" num="0047">Using a compressed gas may advantageously provide a low cost compared to other inflation
            techniques. For example, inflation techniques using chemical reactions may be costly.
            However, in some implementations chemical reactions may occur for use during inflation.
            Alternatively, no chemical reactions occur for use during inflation. Pre-existing
            compressed gas containers may be utilized or adapted for use with the aerial vehicle.
            Currently small CO2 canisters are sold, which can be commonly used for filling bicycle
            tires when bicycle pumps are unavailable. Such canisters can be adapted for use to
            inflate an airbag. Pre-existing compressed gas canisters or containers may be retrofitted
            to provide gas for an aerial vehicle airbag.

            computer readable media that may define operation of the aerial vehicle. The processor
            may determine, based on data, whether to send the signal to the gas valve, or the
            type of signal to be sent. The processor may make this determination in accordance
            with calculations performed on the data or a subset of the data. The controller may
            have one or more memory units that may include non-transitory computer readable media
            that may comprise code, logic, or instructions for performing the one or more steps.
            The processor may generate a signal indicative of a malfunction of the aircraft, which
            may be used to open a gas valve. Alternatively, the controller may receive a signal
            indicative of the malfunction. The signal may be generated on-board the aerial vehicle
            or may be generated from an external device in communication with the aerial vehicle.

         <p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one example, the controller may receive data from one or more sensors, or from

            The signal may or may not dictate the degree to which the gas valve is opened. In
            some instances, the signal may cause a gas valve to close from an open state. In some

         </p>
         <p id="p-0065" num="0064">An aircraft may include an inertial measurement unit (IMU). An IMU can include one
            or more accelerometers, one or more gyroscopes, one or more magnetometers, or suitable
            combinations thereof. For example, the IMU can include up to three orthogonal accelerometers
            to measure linear acceleration of the movable object along up to three axes of translation,
            and up to three orthogonal gyroscopes to measure the angular acceleration about up
            to three axes of rotation. The IMU can be rigidly coupled to the aerial vehicle such
            that the motion of the aerial vehicle corresponds to motion of the IMU. Alternatively
            the IMU can be permitted to move relative to the aerial vehicle with respect to up
            to six degrees of freedom. The IMU can be directly mounted onto the aerial vehicle,
            or coupled to a support structure mounted onto the aerial vehicle. The IMU may be
            provided exterior to or within a housing of the aerial vehicle. The IMU may be permanently
            or removably attached to the aerial vehicle. The IMU can provide a signal indicative
            of the motion of the aerial vehicle, such as a position, orientation, velocity, and/or
            acceleration of the aerial vehicle (e.g., with respect to one, two, or three axes
            of translation, and/or one, two, or three axes of rotation). For example, the IMU
            can sense a signal representative of the acceleration of the aerial vehicle, and the
            signal can be integrated once to provide velocity information, and twice to provide
            location and/or orientation information. The IMU may provide a signal to a valve controller
            and/or an aircraft flight controller.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0066" num="0065">Additional sensors may be provided on an aerial vehicle. For example, one or more
            sensors may be provided that may measure operation of one or more motors or other
            actuators, motor drives, rotors. For example, the sensors may detect the speed at
            which a rotor of an aerial vehicle is turning. The rotor may be part of a propulsion
            system of the aerial vehicle. The rotor may have one or more rotor blades may turn
            to generate lift for the aerial vehicle. In some instances, temperature sensors may
            be provided. Temperature sensors may be able to detect overheating of one or more
            component of the aerial vehicle. Power level sensors may also be provided. Power level
            sensors may detect a state of charge of a power supply, such as a battery or battery
            pack that may power the aerial vehicle. For example, if a power level sensor indicates
            that the aerial vehicle battery is running out of power, this may be indicative that
            the motor and flight control are running out of power. If the aerial vehicle battery
            has run out of power, this may indicate that the propulsion systems have run out of
            power and/or that the aircraft flight controller or master controller may be out of
            power.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0067" num="0066">Information from sensors may be analyzed to determine whether the aerial vehicle is
            in a state in which an airbag must be deployed. In one example, the state may be when
            a malfunction has occurred with the aerial vehicle. This may include conditions where
            the aerial vehicle exhibits a location or motion indicative of a malfunction (e.g.,
            freefall, unusual acceleration, impact, proximity to a surface while traveling at
            a high speed, unusual orientation), when overheating is detected, when a short circuit
            or fire is detected, when a guidance or navigation system stops operating, when communication
            with an external device is lost, when a power supply is very low, when power to one
            or more components of the aerial vehicle is lost. For example, when the IMU data is
            abnormal, when there are issues with multiple motors, motor drives, or rotors, such
            that the aircraft cannot be stabilized, or when the aircraft impacts a building, a
            potential impact state may be determined where it may be desirable to inflate the
            airbag. A valve controller 
            <b>240</b> may then trigger the valve 
            <b>220</b> to be opened, the compressed gas will enter the deflated airbag 
            <b>230</b> and inflate it.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0068" num="0067">One or more alert conditions may be provided which may contribute to detecting a potential
            impact state in which an airbag must be deployed. In some instances a single alert
            condition may be sufficient to trigger inflation of the airbag. Alternatively, certain
            combinations of alert conditions may be needed to trigger inflation of the airbag.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one example, an alert condition may be provided when one or more sensors (e.g.,
            accelerometers) of the aerial vehicle, such as a UAV, detect that the aerial vehicle
            is in free fall. The acceleration of the aerial vehicle may be reflective that the
            aerial vehicle is falling with an acceleration equal to that of gravity. In some instances,
            an alert condition may be provided when an acceleration of the aircraft is greater
            than an acceleration that the aircraft can produce. The alert condition may be triggered
            when this greater acceleration is detected downwards in the direction of gravity,
            or in any other direction. It may be desirable to trigger inflation of the airbag
            when the aerial vehicle is in free fall or moving with an acceleration that exceeds
            a predetermined threshold.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another example, an alert condition may occur when the aircraft is traveling at
            a velocity that exceeds a predetermined threshold. Optionally, an alert condition
            may occur when the aircraft is traveling at a velocity that exceeds a predetermined
            threshold while the aircraft is within a predetermined proximity of a surface that
            it may impact. For example, if the aerial vehicle is at a low altitude (close to the
            ground) and is traveling downward at a velocity that exceeds a predetermined threshold,
            an alert condition may occur. In another example, if the aerial vehicle is close to
            a surface of a building and is heading toward the surface of the building at a velocity
            that exceeds a predetermined velocity, an alert condition may be raised. This may
            suggest that an impact is imminent and it may be desirable to inflate an airbag.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0071" num="0070">In another case, an alert condition may occur when the orientation of the aerial vehicle
            changes at a frequency that exceeds a predetermined threshold frequency or in a particular
            manner. For example, high frequency orientation changes or wobbling may be indicative
            of instability. The instability may indicate that the aerial vehicle will fall soon
            and/or that impact is imminent, for which inflation of an airbag may be desirable.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0072" num="0071">An alert condition may also occur when the orientation of the aerial vehicle is outside
            a predetermined range. For example, if the aerial vehicle (e.g., a UAV, such as a
            rotorcraft) is upside down a fall may be imminent and an alert condition may be provided.
            Similarly, if the aerial vehicle is oriented so that it is more than 90 degrees tilted
            relative to gravity (e.g., more upside down than right side up), an alert condition
            may be provided. The orientation of the aerial vehicle may indicate instability, loss
            of control of the vehicle, or that the aerial vehicle will plummet toward a surface,
            such as the ground, and may trigger inflation of an airbag.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0073" num="0072">The detected conditions of motors, motor drives, or rotors of an aerial vehicle may
            also pertain to the generation of an alert condition. For example, if a motor that
            is driving a propulsion unit has stopped, an alert condition may be provided. Similarly,
            if it is detected that a rotor has stopped rotating or is rotating below a predetermined
            threshold, an alert condition may occur. In some instances, calculations may be performed
            to determine whether other motors or rotors are compensating for the stopped/slowed
            motor or rotor. If compensation is not sufficient, the stopping of the motor or rotor
            may indicate the aerial vehicle will lose propulsion (e.g., lift) or control, and
            may fall or suffer an impact. This may trigger inflation of airbag.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0074" num="0073">Additionally an alert condition may be provided when a temperature sensor detects
            overheating of one or more component of the aerial vehicle. When the sensed temperature
            exceeds a predetermined threshold temperature, overheating may be indicated. Overheating
            may be indicative that a portion of the aerial vehicle may stop working, or that safety
            mechanisms may kick in to shut off the portion of the aerial vehicle. The shut-off
            of certain portions of the aerial vehicle (e.g., propulsion) may cause the aerial
            vehicle to fall or suffer an impact. The shut-off of other portions of the aerial
            vehicle (e.g., navigation/communication) may cause the aerial vehicle to operate blindly
            or without control, which may also lead to impact or damage to the aerial vehicle.
            A release of an airbag may be desirable in such situations.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further alert conditions may occur when a power charge level of a power supply is
            low. For example, an aerial vehicle may have one or more power supplies, such as batteries
            or battery packs powering portions of the aerial vehicle. For example, one or more
            power supplies may power the entire aerial vehicle, or different portions or systems
            of the aerial vehicle. For example, a single power supply may power the propulsion
            of the aerial vehicle, the guidance/navigation of the aerial vehicle, a communication
            interface of the aerial vehicle, a carrier of the aerial vehicle, a payload of the
            aerial vehicle, a sensing system (e.g., IMU) of the aerial vehicle, and/or any other
            system of the aerial vehicle. Alternatively, different power supplies may power one
            or more different portions or systems of the aerial vehicle. When the power supply
            charge level drops beneath a predetermined threshold, this may indicate that the power
            will soon be lost to the portion or system powered by the power supply, which will
            generate an alert condition. For example, when a power supply powering a propulsion
            system of the aerial vehicle drops beneath a threshold charge value, an alert condition
            may occur. This may indicate that the propulsion system may not operate properly or
            will shut down soon. This may lead to the fall or impact of the aerial vehicle, which
            may cause an airbag to be inflated. In another example, a power supply powering a
            guidance/navigation system or a communication system of the aerial vehicle may drop
            beneath a threshold charge value, which may cause an alert condition. This may indicate
            that the aerial vehicle may operate blindly or without control, which may lead to
            impact or damage to the aerial vehicle. This may further cause deployment of an airbag.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0076" num="0075">Similarly, an alert condition may be provided if power is no longer supplied to the
            aerial vehicle or one or more system of the aerial vehicle. For example, if the propulsion
            system loses power, the propulsion units may stop working, which may cause the aerial
            vehicle to fall. In another example, if the guidance/navigation systems or communication
            systems lose power, this could lead to blind operation or instability of the aerial
            vehicle, which may raise the likelihood of impact. If certain sensors lose power this
            may prevent the guidance/navigation from operating properly. Loss of power conditions
            may case an airbag to be deployed.

         <p id="p-0077" num="0076">A valve controller power supply 
            <b>250</b> may be provided as part of an impact protection apparatus. The valve controller power
            supply may provide power to a valve controller 
            <b>240</b>. The valve controller power supply may also provide power to a valve 
            <b>220</b>. The valve controller power supply may supply power to a flow control mechanism,
            which may include one or more valve controllers and one or more valves. The valve
            controller power supply may be a power supply independent of other power supplies
            of the aerial vehicle. A flow control mechanism may be capable of functioning to cause
            inflation of an inflatable member, even if other power supplies of the aerial vehicle
            no longer function. Even if the rest of the aerial vehicle loses power, a valve controller
            may detect a condition to send a trigger signal to a valve, and the valve may be able
            to open in response to the signal, thereby permitting gas to flow into the inflatable
            member. For example, the valve controller power supply may be a different power supply
            from the rest of the aerial vehicle. The valve controller power supply may be independent
            of a propulsion power supply. Thus, even if the propulsion units lose power the valve
            controller power supply may still supply power to the valve controller and/or valve.
            Similarly, the valve controller power supply may be independent of an aircraft flight
            controller or master controller power supply. Thus, even if power is lost to the aircraft
            flight controller, the valve controller may make the determination whether to provide
            a trigger signal 
            <b>245</b> to the valve 
            <b>220</b>. The valve controller may provide a trigger signal to the valve when it is detected
            that power has been lost to the aircraft flight controller or the master controller.
            The valve controller may power supply may also be independent of a guidance system
            and/or communication system power supply. Thus, even if the aerial vehicle is no longer
            operating with functional navigation or guidance controls, or has lost communication
            with an external device, such as a remote terminal, the valve control power supply
            may still supply power to the valve controller.

            <b>250</b> that is independent of other power supplies of the aerial vehicle may advantageously
            permit triggering of an airbag when power is lost to the rest of the aerial vehicle.
            Power loss to the rest of the aerial vehicle may be one of the conditions in which
            case inflating an airbag is important. This provides advantages over traditional systems
            where the master control is powered with the same power supply as the valve controller.
            In those situations, if the battery runs out of power, the motor and flight control
            are also out of power. If the master control fails there is no way to transmit a trigger
            signal to inflate an airbag, which may be at one of the most crucial points. Thus,
            systems, methods, and devices provided herein advantageously provide a separately
            powered valve control.

            <b>300</b> utilizing a safety mechanism in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The
            impact protection apparatus may be provided for an aerial vehicle, such as a UAV.
            The impact protection apparatus may include a container 
            <b>310</b> configured to enclose a fluid, a flow control valve 
            <b>320</b>, and an inflatable member 
            <b>330</b>. The gas valve may control flow of the gas from the container to the inflatable member.
            A valve controller 
            <b>340</b> may be in communication with the gas valve and may control operation of the gas valve
            by a trigger signal 
            <b>345</b> that may be sent to the gas valve. A valve controller power supply 
            <b>350</b> may be provided and configured to provide power to the valve controller. A safety
            mechanism 
            <b>360</b> may be provided that, unless deactivated, prevents inflation of the inflatable member.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0082" num="0081">A container 
            <b>310</b> may contain a fluid, such as a gas. Preferably, the fluid may be a compressed gas.
            Alternatively, the fluid may include a liquid, or a mixture of gas and liquid. The
            fluid may be pressurized or compressed. The fluid may be delivered to the inflatable
            member 
            <b>330</b> to cause the inflatable member to inflate. The flow control valve 
            <b>320</b> may control flow of the fluid from the container to the inflatable member. In some
            instances, the valve may initially be at a closed state which may prevent flow of
            the fluid from the container to the inflatable member. The valve may be opened in
            response to a signal from a valve controller 
            <b>340</b>. Opening the valve may cause the fluid from the container to enter the inflatable
            member, and inflate the inflatable member.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0083" num="0082">The valve controller 
            <b>340</b> may be powered by a valve controller power supply 
            <b>350</b>. The valve controller power supply may be independent of one or more other power
            supplies of the aerial vehicle. For example, the valve controller power supply may
            be independent of a power supply powering a propulsion mechanism of the aerial vehicle,
            or a master controller of the aerial vehicle. The valve controller may be capable
            of operating even when the rest of the aerial vehicle runs out of power, or is shut
            down. Thus, a valve controller may provide a signal to trigger inflation of the inflatable
            member, regardless of whether the rest of the aerial vehicle is operational or not.
            The valve controller may send the trigger signal in response to one or more signal
            or sensor input. The valve controller may perform analysis of the signal or sensor
            input in order to determine whether to provide the trigger signal. The valve controller
            may make such determinations on a continuous, periodic, or episodic basis.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0084" num="0083">In another example, the valve controller may provide a trigger signal in response
            to a signal from a terminal that is remote to the aerial vehicle. The terminal may
            communicate with the aerial vehicle. In some instances, the terminal may control positioning,
            orientation, or flight of the aerial vehicle. The terminal may receive data from the
            aerial vehicle, such as location or flight information, or data collected by a payload
            of the aerial vehicle. In some instances, a user may provide an input to the terminal
            to trigger deployment of the airbag remotely. For example, a user may witness that
            the aerial vehicle is about to impact something, and may remotely trigger the airbag
            inflation. The communication system with the terminal may be powered by the valve
            controller power supply 
            <b>350</b> or another power supply. In some instances, the communication from the terminal to
            the valve controller 
            <b>340</b> may occur, even if other parts of the aerial vehicle (e.g., propulsion unit, flight
            controller, master controller, guidance/navigation) are failing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, a safety mechanism 
            <b>360</b> may be provided that, unless deactivated, prevents inflation of the inflatable member.
            In some instances, the default of the safety mechanism may be to be on and to prevent
            inflation of the inflatable member. This may prevent an airbag from deploying prematurely.
            For example, this may prevent the airbag from deploying and injuring a person when
            the aircraft is being carried by the person. This may prevent an airbag from deploying
            while the aircraft is not on (or is not supposed to be on but erroneously turned off),
            or is being transported by an individual. In one example, after a flight control of
            the aerial vehicle is turned on or enabled, the propulsion units of the aerial vehicle
            (e.g., rotors) may begin to function for flight. When the flight control is turned
            on, a signal may be transmitted to a safety mechanism, which will be deactivated (or
            be turned ‘off’). Deactivating the safety mechanism may permit the airbag to deploy
            in response to a trigger signal from a valve controller 
            <b>340</b>. The safety mechanism may be deactivated by a safety signal indicating that the unmanned
            aerial vehicle is in operation. The safety signal may be provided by a flight control
            system of the unmanned aerial vehicle or another system of the unmanned aerial vehicle.

         <p id="p-0086" num="0085">In another embodiment, the safety mechanism 
            <b>360</b> may include a safety pin. The safety pin can be provided, similar to a fire extinguisher,
            so that if the pin is not pulled, the airbag cannot inflate. In some embodiments,
            the safety mechanism comprises a pin and deactivation of the safety mechanism may
            comprise removal of the pin. The pin may be configured to be removed by a user prior
            to operation of the aerial vehicle. The pin may be manually removed by the user prior
            to the aerial vehicle being permitted to operate. In some instances, the aerial vehicle
            may not be capable of operating without removing the safety pin first. In another
            example, turning on the aerial vehicle or operating the aerial vehicle may automatically
            cause the safety pin to be removed.

            When deploying, the airbag may be configured to pass through an opening of a UAV body
            housing, or to cause a portion of a UAV body housing to come off. Alternatively, the

            portion of the UAV is in the direction of gravity g, while an ‘upward’ portion is
            opposite the direction of gravity g. The UAV may change orientation when out of control
            (e.g., flip) so that the upward portion of the UAV is facing toward the earth and
            the downward portion of the UAV is facing toward the sky. In such situations it may
            be advantageous to have airbags that may deploy above and below the UAV. In some instances,
            the UAV may tumble while falling, so it may be difficult to predict which side the
            UAV may land. In such situations it would be advantageous to have airbags on multiple
            sides of the UAV to protect the UAV when landing at an unpredictable angle.

            1:1.2, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, or 1:6. The ratio of a footprint of an inflated

         </p>
         <p id="p-0101" num="0100">The position and number of airbags depends on an aircraft model, size, volume, weight,
            and other factors. For example, smaller airbags may be used or fewer airbags may be
            used for a UAV, than an aircraft that is designed to carry one or more passengers.
            The airbags may be configured to protect the aerial vehicle from one angle or multiple
            angles. For example, the airbags may be configured to reduce the forces experienced
            by the aerial vehicle when impact occurs beneath the aerial vehicle, above the aerial
            vehicle, a side of the aerial vehicle, and/or any other angle of the aerial vehicle.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0102" num="0101">All airbags may be deployed simultaneously. In some instances, detecting a state in
            which the airbags ought to be deployed may result in all airbags of the aerial vehicle
            being deployed. In some instances, this may be advantageous in situations where it
            may be difficult to predict which side the aerial vehicle may impact a surface or
            other device. Alternatively, a selected number of airbags may be deployed. For example,
            if it is detected that the impact will likely come from a bottom side of the aerial
            vehicle, airbags on the bottom side of the aerial vehicle may be deployed. Alternatively,
            if it is detected that the impact will likely from the top or side of the aerial vehicle,
            airbags on the top and/or side may be deployed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0103" num="0102">Deployment of the airbags may reduce damage likely to be taken by the aerial vehicle
            upon impact. Similarly, deployment of airbags may reduce damage or injury to a load
            of an aerial vehicle, such as a payload (e.g., camera, illumination devices, audio
            devices, measurement or sensing equipment), passengers, or any other item carried
            by or attached to the aerial vehicle. Impact may occur when an aerial vehicle impacts
            a surface (e.g., ground, wall, ceiling, water, cliffs), possible obstructions (e.g.,
            trees, foliage, people or other living beings, poles, lighting units, power lines,
            billboards, buildings), or moving objects (e.g., other aerial vehicles, other types
            of vehicles, living beings).

            environment, such as in air (e.g., a fixed-wing aircraft, a rotary-wing aircraft,
            or an aircraft having neither fixed wings nor rotary wings), in water (e.g., a ship
            or a submarine), on ground (e.g., a motor vehicle, such as a car, truck, bus, van,
            motorcycle; a movable structure or frame such as a stick, fishing pole; or a train),
            under the ground (e.g., a subway), in space (e.g., a spaceplane, a satellite, or a
            probe), or any combination of these environments. The movable object can be a vehicle,
            such as a vehicle described elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, the movable object
            can be mounted on a living subject, such as a human or an animal. Suitable animals
            can include avines, canines, felines, equines, bovines, ovines, porcines, delphines,
            rodents, or insects.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0106" num="0105">The movable object may be capable of moving freely within the environment with respect
            to six degrees of freedom (e.g., three degrees of freedom in translation and three
            degrees of freedom in rotation). Alternatively, the movement of the movable object
            can be constrained with respect to one or more degrees of freedom, such as by a predetermined
            path, track, or orientation. The movement can be actuated by any suitable actuation
            mechanism, such as an engine or a motor. The actuation mechanism of the movable object
            can be powered by any suitable energy source, such as electrical energy, magnetic
            energy, solar energy, wind energy, gravitational energy, chemical energy, nuclear
            energy, or any suitable combination thereof. The movable object may be self-propelled
            via a propulsion system, as described elsewhere herein. The propulsion system may
            optionally run on an energy source, such as electrical energy, magnetic energy, solar
            energy, wind energy, gravitational energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy, or any
            suitable combination thereof. Alternatively, the movable object may be carried by
            a living being.

            water vehicles, aerial vehicles, space vehicles, or ground vehicles. For example,
            aerial vehicles may be fixed-wing aircraft (e.g., airplane, gliders), rotary-wing
            aircraft (e.g., helicopters, rotorcraft), aircraft having both fixed wings and rotary
            wings, or aircraft having neither (e.g., blimps, hot air balloons). A vehicle can
            be self-propelled, such as self-propelled through the air, on or in water, in space,
            or on or under the ground. A self-propelled vehicle can utilize a propulsion system,
            such as a propulsion system including one or more engines, motors, wheels, axles,
            magnets, rotors, propellers, blades, nozzles, or any suitable combination thereof.
            In some instances, the propulsion system can be used to enable the movable object
            to take off from a surface, land on a surface, maintain its current position and/or
            orientation (e.g., hover), change orientation, and/or change position.

         <p id="p-0108" num="0107">The movable object can be controlled remotely by a user or controlled locally by an
            occupant within or on the movable object. In some embodiments, the movable object

            a UAV, may not have an occupant onboard the movable object. The movable object can
            be controlled by a human or an autonomous control system (e.g., a computer control
            system), or any suitable combination thereof. The movable object can be an autonomous

            movable object directly or indirectly. The carrier can provide support to the payload
            (e.g., carry at least part of the weight of the payload). The carrier can include
            a suitable mounting structure (e.g., a gimbal platform) capable of stabilizing and/or
            directing the movement of the payload. In some embodiments, the carrier can be adapted
            to control the state of the payload (e.g., position and/or orientation) relative to
            the movable object. For example, the carrier can be configured to move relative to
            the movable object (e.g., with respect to one, two, or three degrees of translation
            and/or one, two, or three degrees of rotation) such that the payload maintains its
            position and/or orientation relative to a suitable reference frame regardless of the
            movement of the movable object. The reference frame can be a fixed reference frame
            (e.g., the surrounding environment). Alternatively, the reference frame can be a moving
            reference frame (e.g., the movable object, a payload target).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, the carrier can be configured to permit movement of the payload
            relative to the carrier and/or movable object. The movement can be a translation with
            respect to up to three degrees of freedom (e.g., along one, two, or three axes) or
            a rotation with respect to up to three degrees of freedom (e.g., about one, two, or
            three axes), or any suitable combination thereof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some instances, the carrier can include a carrier frame assembly and a carrier
            actuation assembly. The carrier frame assembly can provide structural support to the
            payload. The carrier frame assembly can include individual carrier frame components,
            some of which can be movable relative to one another. The carrier actuation assembly
            can include one or more actuators (e.g., motors) that actuate movement of the individual
            carrier frame components. The actuators can permit the movement of multiple carrier
            frame components simultaneously, or may be configured to permit the movement of a
            single carrier frame component at a time. The movement of the carrier frame components
            can produce a corresponding movement of the payload. For example, the carrier actuation
            assembly can actuate a rotation of one or more carrier frame components about one
            or more axes of rotation (e.g., roll axis, pitch axis, or yaw axis). The rotation
            of the one or more carrier frame components can cause a payload to rotate about one
            or more axes of rotation relative to the movable object. Alternatively or in combination,
            the carrier actuation assembly can actuate a translation of one or more carrier frame
            components along one or more axes of translation, and thereby produce a translation
            of the payload along one or more corresponding axes relative to the movable object.

         <p id="p-0122" num="0121">One or more airbags may be deployed in the event of a detected state, such as a malfunction.
            The airbags may be deployed to reduce forces experienced upon impact. The airbags
            may be deployed to protect any portion of the movable object, and/or load of the object.
            The airbags may be deployed to protect the payload or carrier of the movable object.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some embodiments, the movement of the movable object, carrier, and payload relative
            to a fixed reference frame (e.g., the surrounding environment) and/or to each other,
            can be controlled by a terminal. The terminal can be a remote control device at a
            location distant from the movable object, carrier, and/or payload. The terminal can
            be disposed on or affixed to a support platform. Alternatively, the terminal can be
            a handheld or wearable device. For example, the terminal can include a smartphone,
            tablet, laptop, computer, glasses, gloves, helmet, microphone, or suitable combinations
            thereof. The terminal can include a user interface, such as a keyboard, mouse, joystick,
            touchscreen, or display. Any suitable user input can be used to interact with the
            terminal, such as manually entered commands, voice control, gesture control, or position
            control (e.g., via a movement, location or tilt of the terminal).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0124" num="0123">The terminal can be used to control any suitable state of the movable object, carrier,
            and/or payload. For example, the terminal can be used to control the position and/or
            orientation of the movable object, carrier, and/or payload relative to a fixed reference
            from and/or to each other. In some embodiments, the terminal can be used to control
            individual elements of the movable object, carrier, and/or payload, such as the actuation
            assembly of the carrier, a sensor of the payload, or an emitter of the payload. The
            terminal can include a wireless communication device adapted to communicate with one
            or more of the movable object, carrier, or payload.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0125" num="0124">The terminal can include a suitable display unit for viewing information of the movable
            object, carrier, and/or payload. For example, the terminal can be configured to display
            information of the movable object, carrier, and/or payload with respect to position,
            translational velocity, translational acceleration, orientation, angular velocity,
            angular acceleration, or any suitable combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the
            terminal can display information provided by the payload, such as data provided by
            a functional payload (e.g., images recorded by a camera or other image capturing device).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0126" num="0125">Optionally, the same terminal may both control the movable object, carrier, and/or
            payload, or a state of the movable object, carrier and/or payload, as well as receive
            and/or display information from the movable object, carrier and/or payload. For example,
            a terminal may control the positioning of the payload relative to an environment,
            while displaying image data captured by the payload, or information about the position
            of the payload. Alternatively, different terminals may be used for different functions.
            For example, a first terminal may control movement or a state of the movable object,
            carrier, and/or payload while a second terminal may receive and/or display information
            from the movable object, carrier, and/or payload. For example, a first terminal may
            be used to control the positioning of the payload relative to an environment while
            a second terminal displays image data captured by the payload. Various communication
            modes may be utilized between a movable object and an integrated terminal that both
            controls the movable object and receives data, or between the movable object and multiple
            terminals that both control the movable object and receives data. For example, at
            least two different communication modes may be formed between the movable object and
            the terminal that both controls the movable object and receives data from the movable
            object.

            <b>702</b> and a payload 
            <b>704</b>, in accordance with embodiments. Although the movable object 
            <b>700</b> is depicted as an aircraft, this depiction is not intended to be limiting, and any
            suitable type of movable object can be used, as previously described herein. One of
            skill in the art would appreciate that any of the embodiments described herein in
            the context of aircraft systems can be applied to any suitable movable object (e.g.,
            an UAV). In some instances, the payload 
            <b>704</b> may be provided on the movable object 
            <b>700</b> without requiring the carrier 
            <b>702</b>. The movable object 
            <b>700</b> may include propulsion mechanisms 
            <b>706</b>, a sensing system 
            <b>708</b>, and a communication system 
            <b>710</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0128" num="0127">The propulsion mechanisms 
            <b>706</b> can include one or more of rotors, propellers, blades, engines, motors, wheels, axles,
            magnets, or nozzles, as previously described. For example, the propulsion mechanisms
            
            <b>706</b> may be rotor assemblies, or other rotary propulsion units. The movable object may
            have one or more, two or more, three or more, or four or more propulsion mechanisms.
            The propulsion mechanisms may all be of the same type. Alternatively, one or more
            propulsion mechanisms can be different types of propulsion mechanisms. The propulsion
            mechanisms 
            <b>706</b> can be mounted on the movable object 
            <b>700</b> using any suitable means, such as a support element (e.g., a drive shaft) as described
            elsewhere herein. The propulsion mechanisms 
            <b>706</b> can be mounted on any suitable portion of the movable object 
            <b>700</b>, such on the top, bottom, front, back, sides, or suitable combinations thereof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some embodiments, the propulsion mechanisms 
            <b>706</b> can enable the movable object 
            <b>700</b> to take off vertically from a surface or land vertically on a surface without requiring
            any horizontal movement of the movable object 
            <b>700</b> (e.g., without traveling down a runway). Optionally, the propulsion mechanisms 
            <b>706</b> can be operable to permit the movable object 
            <b>700</b> to hover in the air at a specified position and/or orientation. One or more of the
            propulsion mechanisms 
            <b>700</b> may be controlled independently of the other propulsion mechanisms. Alternatively,
            the propulsion mechanisms 
            <b>700</b> can be configured to be controlled simultaneously. For example, the movable object
            
            <b>700</b> can have multiple horizontally oriented rotors that can provide lift and/or thrust
            to the movable object. The multiple horizontally oriented rotors can be actuated to
            provide vertical takeoff, vertical landing, and hovering capabilities to the movable
            object 
            <b>700</b>. In some embodiments, one or more of the horizontally oriented rotors may spin in
            a clockwise direction, while one or more of the horizontally rotors may spin in a
            counterclockwise direction. For example, the number of clockwise rotors may be equal
            to the number of counterclockwise rotors. The rotation rate of each of the horizontally
            oriented rotors can be varied independently in order to control the lift and/or thrust
            produced by each rotor, and thereby adjust the spatial disposition, velocity, and/or
            acceleration of the movable object 
            <b>700</b> (e.g., with respect to up to three degrees of translation and up to three degrees
            of rotation).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0130" num="0129">The sensing system 
            <b>708</b> can include one or more sensors that may sense the spatial disposition, velocity,
            and/or acceleration of the movable object 
            <b>700</b> (e.g., with respect to up to three degrees of translation and up to three degrees
            of rotation). The one or more sensors can include global positioning system (GPS)
            sensors, motion sensors, inertial sensors, proximity sensors, or image sensors. The
            sensing data provided by the sensing system 
            <b>708</b> can be used to control the spatial disposition, velocity, and/or orientation of the
            movable object 
            <b>700</b> (e.g., using a suitable processing unit and/or control module, as described below).
            Alternatively, the sensing system 
            <b>708</b> can be used to provide data regarding the environment surrounding the movable object,
            such as weather conditions, proximity to potential obstacles, location of geographical
            features, location of manmade structures, and the like. The sensing system data may
            be useful in determining conditions under which to deploy one or more airbags of the
            movable object.

            <b>714</b> may include any number of transmitters, receivers, and/or transceivers suitable for
            wireless communication. The communication may be one-way communication, such that
            data can be transmitted in only one direction. For example, one-way communication
            may involve only the movable object 
            <b>700</b> transmitting data to the terminal 
            <b>712</b>, or vice-versa. The data may be transmitted from one or more transmitters of the
