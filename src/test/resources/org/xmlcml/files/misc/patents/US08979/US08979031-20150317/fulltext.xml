<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An aerial delivery system is configured to allow delivery of one or more releasable items after the system is extracted from an aircraft. One or more linear guidance devices and releasable securing mechanisms allow the aerial delivery system to deploy one or more releasable items at an appropriate time. The releasable securing mechanisms may utilize one or more rotatable latch plates. The one or more releasable items may be deployed simultaneously, or in a staged or staggered fashion. Through use of drag or lift-producing devices, the system may be recovered and reused. The attitude and/or azimuth orientation of the system may be varied prior to, during, and/or after release of a releasable item.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to aerial delivery, particularly delivery achieved via mid-air extraction from an aircraft, and systems and methods related thereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aerial delivery is a term used to describe extracting an item from an aircraft in flight and then enabling a safe recovery of the item by use of an aerodynamic decelerator, which is most often a parachute system. Additionally, the aerial delivery operation is typically conducted from a cargo-type aircraft. The process may utilize very specific aerial delivery equipment and may adhere to very specific aerial delivery operational procedures. Often, the extracted item consists of an aerial delivery system containing cargo of some sort.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Two general types of extraction are utilized. Gravity extraction is the technique of using positive aircraft pitch angle, or by using some other force to cause the item to simply roll or slide out of the aircraft, which is typically followed by a parachute being deployed by a lanyard that is anchored to the aircraft. Parachute extraction is a technique whereby a parachute is first deployed out the rear of the cargo compartment, and the parachute is used to pull the item from the aircraft. Both techniques may conform to guidelines regarding length, weight, mass, etc., of the item being extracted in order to achieve a safe extraction operation. Generally speaking, relatively short and/or relatively lightweight items may be gravity extracted, but relatively long and/or relatively heavy items may preferably be parachute extracted, which removes the item from the aircraft quickly to prevent it from adversely affecting the aircraft's center of balance.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Items having a generally cylindrical shape, such as bombs that are powered by gravity, will typically be released from the belly or wing of a bomber or fighter aircraft. In practice, these items are released vertically but their longitudinal axis is substantially horizontal. Because the lower bomb racks in a bomb bay may be repositioned before other items can be released from racks above them, a simultaneous release of all items in the bomb bay cannot generally be conducted. The relatively long release time, coupled with a relatively high airspeed that is a feature of these aircraft, prevents the items from impacting in a concentrated area. Instead, the resulting impact path of the items is quite lengthy and the resulting impact effect is known as carpet bombing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For aerial launching of chemical energy powered items, such as missiles, yet another technique is used. In this scenario, items are loaded into linear guidance devices, which are typically referred to as launchers. Typically, these launchers are either tubular or monorail (dovetail) in design, and are mounted substantially horizontally on fighter airplanes or helicopters. In practice, these items are generally powered by a self-contained rocket motor, allowing only one item to be loaded per launcher. Otherwise, the rocket blast from the front item could damage the item behind it, perhaps even causing it to explode while it is still in the launcher.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another scenario, the GBU-43/B Massive Ordinance Air Blast (&#x201c;MOAB&#x201d;) munition is secured in a cradle atop an aerial delivery system that is parachute extracted from the cargo compartment of a cargo aircraft. The MOAB cradle is just that&#x2014;a cradle; and, because the MOAB is a winged item, it must be separated from its cradle immediately outside the aircraft, with the extraction parachute still attached to the aerial delivery system, before the cradle can pitch or roll significantly&#x2014;otherwise, the MOAB is likely to be damaged or released in an undesirable attitude. In the separation process, the MOAB has forward momentum due to inertia imparted by the aircraft, but the aerial delivery system and cradle will slow significantly, due to drag created by the still attached extraction parachute. The aerial delivery system will also pitch, with its leading edge going downward due to gravity and aerodynamic forces. The combination of relative longitudinal motion and a pitch-down of the aerial delivery system and cradle, allow the platform and cradle to move down and rearward, away from the MOAB. However, because this separation technique does not provide linear guidance control, or roll and yaw control, relative to the cradle, the rear control surfaces of the MOAB must be in a retracted configuration until after the separation event has occurred. Even though this marginally controlled separation technique is acceptable for the MOAB, it may be unsuitable if the separation event were significantly delayed after the system has been released from the aircraft. Further, because the separation technique provides no directional control or roll and yaw control for the separating item, it may be unsuitable for launching items with extended rear-mounted control surfaces, such as fins. With no directional or roll and yaw control, it may also be unsuitable for simultaneously launching multiple items that have any type of extended control surfaces.</p>

Thus, if multiple releasable items <b>199</b> are released, they may all land in one small area or, by using specific time intervals between releases and/or by using drag or lift-producing devices to slow the descent rate or to provide traversing capability of releasable items <b>199</b>, multiple targets can be reached. Moreover, as discussed below, the attitude and/or azimuth of aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be varied before and/or between releases in order to more effectively direct releasable items <b>199</b> toward one or more targets.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Multiple releasable items <b>199</b> may be dropped individually, or they may be dropped simultaneously, or they may be released as any combination of the two. For example, successive individual releasable items <b>199</b>, such as &#x201c;bunker buster&#x201d; bombs, may be released, each time-sequenced to arrive in a manner configured to form a successively deeper crater, and then multiple releasable items <b>199</b> may be released simultaneously to act as a &#x201c;knockout punch.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, in accordance with various exemplary embodiments, because releasable items <b>199</b> are dependent on gravity to extract them from linear guidance device <b>120</b>, multiple chemical propelled devices (such as missiles) can be accommodated by individual linear guidance devices <b>120</b> (e.g., by delaying rocket motor ignition until each missile has separated from linear guidance device <b>120</b>). Additionally, because aerial delivery system <b>100</b> will have minimal airspeed once extracted from an aircraft, an entire group of releasable items <b>199</b> may be released to impact in one concentrated area instead of having a typical carpet-bombing pattern, even if no guidance system is used. Further, release of one or more releasable items <b>199</b> may be delayed for an extended period after aerial delivery system <b>100</b> has been extracted from an aircraft. In various exemplary embodiments, release of a releasable item <b>199</b> from aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be delayed for a time between about five (5) seconds and one (1) minute after extraction of aerial delivery system <b>100</b>. However, release of a releasable item <b>199</b> may be delayed any appropriate amount of time configured to achieve a desired delivery objective for releasable item <b>199</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If aerial delivery system <b>100</b> is to descend into hostile terrain, or into a combat zone, it may be preferable to allow aerial delivery system <b>100</b> to simply land at a relatively high rate of descent under stabilization device <b>150</b>. Alternatively, it may be preferable to release stabilization device <b>150</b> in mid-air, causing aerial delivery system <b>100</b> to crash, and allowing one or more components of aerial delivery system <b>100</b> to be damaged or destroyed. For this purpose, a parachute release mechanism, such as the mechanism disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,264,205, may be suitably employed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">However, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be expensive and, if conditions allow, it is very likely that a system user will desire to reuse aerial delivery system <b>100</b> or a portion thereof. According to an exemplary embodiment, a release mechanism can be used to release stabilization device <b>150</b> from aerial delivery system <b>100</b>. The departing stabilization device <b>150</b> may then function as a pilot parachute to deploy a recovery device <b>160</b>. Recovery device <b>160</b> may also be deployed in any suitable manner known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, during descent of aerial delivery system <b>100</b>, it may be desirable to control the attitude of aerial delivery system <b>100</b>. For example, if a releasable item <b>199</b> comprises a chemical-propelled rocket, it may be desirable to allow the rocket to be launched at a certain attitude (for example, at a 90 degree angle to the vertical, at a 135 degree angle to the vertical, and/or the like) rather than directly downward. Accordingly, the aerial delivery system <b>100</b> of the present disclosure may be configured to support varied attitudes. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref>, and in accordance with various exemplary embodiments, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be configured to achieve various attitudes once deployed. For example, with reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a generally rectangular aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be suspended beneath a parachute <b>220</b> via one or more slings <b>210</b> coupled to aerial delivery system <b>100</b> at locations <b>210</b>A and <b>210</b>B. Slings <b>210</b> are of about equal length; thus, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> is oriented substantially vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">However, the attitude of aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be varied by changing the length of one or more slings <b>210</b>. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> is coupled to one or more slings <b>210</b> at locations <b>210</b>A and <b>2101</b>. As illustrated, the length of sling <b>210</b> coupled to location <b>210</b>B is shorter than the length of sling <b>210</b> coupled to location <b>210</b>A. Thus, due to the uneven sling length, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> is oriented at least partially away from the vertical, as shown. In this manner, mid-air release of one or more releasable items <b>199</b> at an angle away from vertical may be achieved. For example, when releasable item <b>199</b> is a chemical-propelled rocket, the rocket may be at least partially pointed toward a desired target, and thus post-release course corrections and other adjustments to the trajectory of releasable item <b>199</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Moreover, the attitude of aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may also be varied by changing the location of one or more sling attachment fittings. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> is coupled to one or more slings <b>210</b> at locations <b>210</b>A and <b>210</b>C. As illustrated, although the length of sling <b>210</b> coupled to location <b>210</b>A is about the same as the length of sling <b>210</b> coupled to location <b>2100</b>, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> is oriented away from the vertical as a result of the placement of locations <b>210</b>A and <b>210</b>C. As before, mid-air release of one or more releasable items <b>199</b> at an angle away from vertical may thus be achieved. Moreover, with further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, various sling mounting locations may be utilized to achieve a desired attitude of aerial delivery system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition to controlling, selecting, and/or otherwise modifying the attitude of aerial delivery system <b>100</b>, the azimuth of aerial delivery system can be controlled, selected, and/or otherwise modified in order to &#x201c;point&#x201d; aerial delivery system <b>100</b> in a desired direction. For example, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be coupled to a guided parachute, and aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may thus be &#x201c;pointed&#x201d; via operation of the guided parachute. Moreover, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may also be configured to achieve a modified azimuth orientation when coupled to either a guided parachute or a non-guided parachute. For example, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be further equipped with a rotating mechanism located between the payload portion of aerial delivery system <b>100</b> and the parachute. In this manner, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be configured to achieve a particular azimuth orientation responsive to operation of the rotating mechanism. Such flexibility can be extremely valuable, for example, when orienting chemical-propelled rockets for eventual release and separation from aerial delivery system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, and in accordance with various exemplary embodiments, illustrated is a mechanism for achieving azimuth control of aerial delivery system <b>100</b> while descending under the influence of parachute <b>320</b>. Aerial delivery system <b>100</b> is coupled to one or more slings <b>310</b>. A rotation mechanism <b>306</b> is disposed between slings <b>310</b> and parachute <b>320</b>. Rotation mechanism <b>306</b> may comprise any suitable mechanism configured to impart a rotational force. For example, rotation mechanism <b>306</b> may comprise an electric motor, a spring, a threaded screw, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an exemplary embodiment, rotation mechanism <b>306</b> comprises an electric motor <b>302</b> powered by a battery. Motor <b>302</b> may be coupled to control and guidance electronics, for example electronics configured to bring aerial delivery system <b>100</b> into a preset azimuth orientation, for example due west (270 degrees). Moreover, motor <b>302</b> and/or the associated control and guidance electronics may be configured for remote control, such that the azimuth orientation of aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be repeatedly modified and/or updated, for example responsive to commands from a system operator. Motor <b>302</b> further comprises motor shaft <b>304</b>, which is coupled to a suspension line of parachute <b>320</b>. Upon activation of motor <b>302</b>, motor shaft <b>304</b> is rotated, and aerial delivery system <b>100</b> thus rotates beneath parachute <b>320</b> responsive to the rotation of motor shaft <b>304</b>. In this manner, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be oriented as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Rotation mechanism <b>306</b> may also take advantage of the weight of aerial delivery system <b>100</b> to achieve a modified azimuth orientation. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, in accordance with various exemplary embodiments, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> is suspended beneath parachute <b>320</b>. Aerial delivery system <b>100</b> is coupled to rotation mechanism <b>306</b> via one or more slings <b>310</b>. Rotation mechanism <b>306</b> comprises a lead screw <b>312</b>, a nut <b>314</b>, and a brake <b>316</b>. Slings <b>310</b> may be fastened to rotation mechanism <b>306</b> as appropriate, for example at nut <b>314</b>. Lead screw <b>312</b> and nut <b>314</b> are releasably engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Lead screw <b>312</b> may comprise any suitable structure configured to translate a linear force (for example, a force exerted by aerial delivery system <b>100</b> due to gravity) at least partially into a rotational force. For example, lead screw <b>312</b> may comprise a threaded screw, a corkscrew, and/or the like. In an exemplary embodiment, lead screw <b>312</b> comprises a low-pitch threaded rod. Lead screw <b>312</b> is coupled to nut <b>314</b>. Lead screw <b>312</b> is further configured with an arresting device (for example, a blocking pin) in order to prevent separation of lead screw <b>312</b> and nut <b>314</b> at the end of travel. Lead screw <b>312</b> is further coupled to brake <b>316</b> in order to allow aerial delivery system <b>100</b> to be controllably rotated beneath parachute <b>320</b> as nut <b>314</b> &#x201c;unscrews&#x201d; along lead screw <b>312</b> responsive to the weight of aerial delivery system <b>100</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, lead screw <b>312</b> is an aluminum cylinder configured with a sling attachment fitting at a first end, and a stop pin at a second end. Lead screw <b>312</b> is further configured with a threaded outer groove configured to rotatably couple with nut <b>314</b>. Moreover, lead screw <b>312</b> may comprise any suitable material and may be configured in any appropriate manner in order to cause and/or permit rotation of aerial delivery system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Nut <b>314</b> may comprise any suitable structure configured to couple to lead screw <b>312</b>. Further, nut <b>314</b> may comprise any suitable structure configured to receive at least a portion of rotational force generated by the interaction of lead screw <b>312</b> and nut <b>314</b>, for example by nut <b>314</b> moving along rotating threads of lead screw <b>312</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, nut <b>314</b> is an aluminum structure configured with multiple strap attachment points, and further configured with a threaded inner hole configured to rotatably couple with lead screw <b>312</b>. However, nut <b>314</b> may comprise any suitable material and may be configured in any appropriate manner in order to rotate responsive to the weight of aerial delivery system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Brake <b>316</b> may be any suitable device, mechanism, or system configured to retard the rotation of nut <b>314</b> along lead screw <b>312</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, brake <b>316</b> comprises a mechanical clamp. In various other exemplary embodiments, brake <b>316</b> comprises a band brake controlled by an electromechanical solenoid. Brake <b>316</b> is configured to releasably engage with lead screw <b>312</b> to prevent and allow movement of nut <b>314</b>. Moreover, brake <b>316</b> may be configured for remote control in order to allow a system operator to controllably modify the azimuth orientation of aerial delivery system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The weight of aerial delivery system <b>100</b> beneath parachute <b>320</b> provides a downward force, which is at least partially translated into a rotational force by the interaction of lead screw <b>312</b> and nut <b>314</b>. Initially, brake <b>316</b> is engaged, preventing nut <b>314</b> from &#x201c;unscrewing&#x201d; along lead screw <b>312</b>. As brake <b>316</b> is loosened, nut <b>314</b> begins to rotate along lead screw <b>312</b>, resulting in a modified azimuth orientation for aerial delivery system <b>100</b>. Brake <b>316</b> may be re-engaged at any point, fixing nut <b>314</b> against lead screw <b>312</b> at a desired position. Brake <b>316</b> may also be repeatedly engaged and loosened in order to adjust the azimuth orientation of aerial delivery <b>100</b> as desired, for example responsive to wind gusts, inadvertent rotation of parachute <b>320</b>, and/or the like. In this manner, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be &#x201c;pointed&#x201d; in a particular orientation. Moreover, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be &#x201c;re-pointed&#x201d; at a different orientation if desired, via further operation of brake <b>316</b>. In various embodiments, aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be &#x201c;re-pointed&#x201d; any desired number of times, provided further rotation of nut <b>314</b> with respect to lead screw <b>312</b> is still possible (i.e., provided that nut <b>314</b> has not traversed to the end of lead screw <b>312</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As will be appreciated, the above-illustrated principles regarding attitude and/or azimuth orientation, adjustment, and control for an aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be applied in various settings, configurations, combinations, and/or the like, such that a particular aerial delivery system <b>100</b> and associated payload (e.g., one or more releasable items <b>199</b>) may be rotated, translated, and/or otherwise moved and/or &#x201c;pointed&#x201d; in any desired direction relative to the associated stabilization system (e.g., a streamer, a ballute, a drogue parachute, a primary parachute, a recovery parachute, and/or the like). In this manner, an extended loiter time for rockets, cameras, and other useful items over a target area can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Aerial delivery system <b>100</b> may be configurable and/or adaptable to receive conventional munitions, for example in connection with various adapters and/or the like. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref>, a conventional munition <b>450</b> is typically equipped with two lugs <b>451</b> that are screwed into the body of munition <b>450</b>. Lugs <b>451</b> then interface with conventional mounting and/or deployment equipment. However, a conventional munition <b>450</b> may be configured to interface with and/or be coupled to aerial delivery system <b>100</b> via any suitable mechanism, for example via use of an adapter <b>455</b> and shoe <b>456</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment an adapter <b>455</b> may be screwed into munition <b>450</b> in place of lug <b>451</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, adapter <b>455</b> comprises a generally cylindrical piece of metal. In various exemplary embodiments, adapter <b>455</b> may be rectangular, ovoid, or other suitable shape.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an exemplary embodiment, adapter <b>455</b> is configured with internal and external threads. The external threads interface with munition <b>450</b>; the internal threads are configured to receive shoe <b>456</b>. Moreover, in various exemplary embodiments, adapter <b>455</b> is configured with features, for example threads, configured to allow a shoe, for example shoe <b>456</b>, to be attached to adapter <b>455</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5C</figref>, in various exemplary embodiments a shoe <b>456</b> may be coupled to each adapter <b>455</b>. Shoe <b>456</b> may be formed of metal, composite materials, or other suitable structural material. Each shoe <b>456</b> is configured to interface with linear guidance device <b>120</b>. In various exemplary embodiments wherein linear guidance device <b>120</b> is configured as a monorail, shoe <b>456</b> may be configured to be slotted into and/or slidably movable with respect to linear guidance device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In various exemplary embodiments, shoe <b>456</b> may be configured with any suitable shape. Shoe <b>456</b> may be round, ovoid, spherical, &#x201c;football&#x201d; shaped, and/or otherwise curved and/or tapered. In an exemplary embodiment, with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, a single shoe <b>456</b> may be configured to couple to multiple adapters <b>455</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, shoe <b>456</b> may be configured to be generally rectangular, with some degree of taper and/or rounding at each end in order to reduce and/or eliminate binding and/or &#x201c;toe stubbing&#x201d; while entering and/or exiting linear guidance device <b>120</b>. Via use of one or more shoes <b>456</b>, munition <b>450</b> may be (i) easily coupled to linear guidance device <b>120</b>, (ii) secured to linear guidance device <b>120</b> in all but the longitudinal direction, and (iii) positively guided by linear guidance device <b>120</b> as it separates from aerial delivery system <b>100</b>. However, it will be appreciated that shoe <b>456</b> may comprise any suitable materials, configurations, and/or dimensions in order to facilitate releasably coupling releasable item <b>199</b> to aerial delivery system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In certain exemplary embodiments, adapter <b>455</b> and shoe <b>456</b> may be integrally formed. For example, a bolt-like structure may be employed, wherein the threaded portion of the bolt may be considered to function as an adapter <b>455</b>, and the &#x201c;head&#x201d; of the bolt may be considered to function as a shoe <b>456</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A through 6C</figref>, when a releasable item is secured in an aerial delivery system that is to be transported in an aircraft, for example aerial delivery system <b>100</b>, the item usually should be secured in such a way as to resist movement in all directions, including lateral (both left and right), vertical (both up and down), and longitudinal (both forward and aft). In various exemplary embodiments, linear guidance device <b>120</b> of aerial delivery system <b>100</b> conveniently provides lateral and vertical restraint.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In various conventional munition mountings, to provide aft longitudinal restraint it is typical secure a rigid blocking element at the aft of a releasable item <b>199</b> (for example, across linear guidance device <b>120</b>). Conventionally, to provide forward longitudinal restraint, it is typical to install a taut strap assembly in front of, or through, the releasable item <b>199</b>. Following egress of an aerial delivery system from an aircraft, the taut strap that has prevented the releasable item <b>199</b> from moving forward can be severed to allow gravity, or other acceleration forces, to move the releasable item <b>199</b> forward under the guidance of linear guidance device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The above described arrangement is completely adequate when only one item is to be released from one linear guidance device. If however, more than one releasable item <b>199</b> is coupled to a single linear guidance device (for example installed &#x201c;nose to tail&#x201d;), the block used to prevent the first releasable item <b>199</b> from moving aft will also prevent the next releasable item <b>199</b> from moving forward. This issue can be addressed by various means, such as installing two strap assemblies for each releasable item; one to prevent forward movement and one to prevent aft movement. But, that technique is cumbersome, and often would utilize a tightening means and a cutting or releasing means for each of the strap assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In contrast, in accordance with principles of the present disclosure and in various exemplary embodiments, in aerial delivery system <b>100</b> latch-based release mechanisms can be utilized to provide both forward and aft stabilization of a releasable item <b>199</b>. Moreover, exemplary latch based release mechanisms can completely remove a locking element from the interior of linear guidance device <b>120</b> when the locking element is disengaged to release the first releasable item <b>199</b>. It will be appreciated that latch-based release mechanisms in accordance with principles of the present disclosure may be utilized in various mounting, retention and/or release applications, and the exemplary embodiments herein directed to munitions coupling are illustrative and not restrictive.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Additional details regarding latch-plate based releasing mechanisms are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,033,507 to Fox entitled &#x201c;Parachute Release System and Method,&#x201d; the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment an inner latch plate <b>674</b> and outer latch plate <b>676</b> may be configured similarly to an inner latch plate and outer latch plate disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,033,507 to Fox. Inner latch plate <b>674</b> and outer latch plate <b>676</b> may comprise metal (e.g., aluminum, steel, titanium, magnesium, and the like, and/or alloys and combinations of the same), plastic, composite, or any other suitable material. Inner latch plate <b>674</b> and outer latch plate <b>676</b> are each configured with a cavity passing therethrough, for example a cylindrical hole. The cavity is configured to receive a bolt. In this manner, inner latch plate <b>674</b> and outer latch plate <b>676</b> are configured to rotate about an axis of a bolt received within the cylindrical hole.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In various exemplary embodiments, inner latch plate <b>674</b> may be configured with a slot <b>675</b> therethrough; alternatively, inner latch plate <b>674</b> may be configured with a notch <b>675</b>, causing inner latch plate <b>674</b> to somewhat resemble an inverted &#x201c;U.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In various exemplary embodiments, slot/notch <b>675</b> is configured to allow passage of a flexible element <b>679</b>, such as a cable or cord. Flexible element <b>679</b> is coupled to outer latch plate <b>676</b> and to locking element <b>680</b>. By providing some amount of slack in flexible element <b>679</b> between outer latch plate <b>676</b> and locking element <b>680</b>, outer latch plate <b>680</b> will be allowed to build up rotational velocity and some measure of kinetic energy before the flexible element <b>679</b> slack is eliminated and outer latch plate <b>676</b> will, therefore, provide an impulse force, through flexible element <b>679</b>, to snatch locking element <b>680</b> out of releasable item <b>199</b> and into the structure from which releasable item <b>199</b> is being released (for example, into linear guidance device <b>120</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In various exemplary embodiments, inner latch plate <b>674</b> and outer latch plate <b>676</b> primarily function as levers. When inner latch plate <b>674</b> and outer latch plate <b>676</b> are combined to form a latching assembly <b>660</b>, their mechanical advantage is compounded to provide a very strong force to hold a locking element <b>680</b> in place until it is to be released. The efficient compound leverage feature of latching assembly <b>660</b> allows a small force to hold outer latch plate <b>676</b> in its latched position until such time as a release is to occur, even when a large force is acting to push locking element <b>680</b> out of releasable item <b>199</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In various exemplary embodiments, to secure releasable item <b>199</b>, it is desirable to place the locking element <b>680</b> in shear, which can be very efficiently accomplished with a pin configured as a straight pin (a geometric right cylinder). However, a straight pin also typically uses a strong force to disengage it from releasable item <b>199</b> when a shear force is applied between releasable item <b>199</b> and the straight pin. It will be appreciated that force to disengage locking element <b>680</b> from releasable item <b>199</b> could come from a stored energy means, such as a spring, as one example. However, if some locking element <b>680</b> shape other than a straight pin is utilized, the shear force between releasable item <b>199</b> and locking element <b>680</b> can also produce some amount of outward force on locking element <b>680</b>. Typically, therefore, it is advantageous to provide the terminal portion of locking element <b>680</b> with some shape other than straight. And, in various exemplary embodiments it is also advantageous to generally match the cavity shape in releasable item <b>199</b> to the shape of locking element <b>680</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, in various exemplary embodiments, in cross section the portion of locking element <b>680</b> that is to be inserted into releasable item <b>199</b> may be at least somewhat curved and/or tapered, for example circular, polygonal and/or the like. In profile, the insertable portion of locking element <b>680</b> may be straight, tapered, truncated tapered, ogive, semicircular, and/or the like. When locking element <b>680</b> is configured as a pin with a simple taper, the degree of taper can be used to balance the desired outward force on locking element <b>680</b> and latching assembly <b>660</b> being used to resist the outward force. The more the taper diverges from straight, the more outward force there is available when a shear force is applied between releasable item <b>199</b> and locking element <b>680</b>. In various exemplary embodiments, in order to facilitate efficient latching and unlatching, the materials used for the cavity in releasable item <b>199</b>, inner latch plate <b>674</b>, outer latch plate <b>676</b>, and locking element <b>680</b> are relatively hard and smooth, for example one or more of carbon steel, alloy steel, brass, titanium, and/or the like. Depending on the friction coefficient of the elements being utilized, at some degree of taper, or truncated tapers, locking element <b>680</b> is moveable from releasable item <b>680</b> absent any force other than the shear force. The same is true for an ogive shape. It will be appreciated that a locking element <b>680</b> with a semispherical tip is quite efficient for pushing itself from releasable item <b>199</b> responsive to a shear force. In certain exemplary embodiments, locking element <b>680</b> is completely spherical; however, in these exemplary embodiments less than 50% of the sphere extends into releasable item <b>199</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Continuing to reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref>, in various exemplary embodiments, when oriented as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the CG (center of gravity) of inner latch plate <b>674</b> is below, and to the right of, its pivot point. Due to the CG position of this element, it will rotate to the left (clockwise) by some amount if there is no three to oppose it. Outer latch plate <b>676</b>, which is typically more massive than inner latch plate <b>767</b>, typically has its CG above, and to the left of, its pivot point. Due to the CG position of this element, it will also rotate to the left (counterclockwise) if not restrained. In an exemplary embodiment, for the first 90 degrees of rotation, the CG of outer latch plate <b>676</b> will move farther and farther to the left of its pivot point, making it extremely easy for gravity, or some other acceleration force, to cause this element to rotate and increase its rotational rate and build up kinetic energy.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In an exemplary embodiment, outer latch plate <b>676</b> is coupled to flexible element <b>679</b>. In various exemplary embodiments, flexible element <b>679</b> passes through notch <b>675</b> and is coupled to and/or formed integral with locking element <b>680</b>. In certain exemplary embodiments, flexible element <b>679</b> comprises one or more of textile webbing, textile cordage, metallic cable, monofilament, chain, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In various exemplary embodiments, because many variable factors may be involved in the release of releasable item <b>199</b> from aerial delivery system <b>100</b>, such as the force available to move releasable item <b>199</b> relative to the linear guidance device <b>120</b>, the force available to move locking element <b>680</b> from releasable item <b>199</b>, the space available that may effect the length of the levers (i.e., inner latch plate <b>674</b> and/or outer latch plate <b>676</b>), the friction coefficients of the various components, and/or the like, it may be desirable to adjust the size and/or shape of locking element <b>680</b> (and/or and the relative lever lengths of inner latch plate <b>674</b> or outer latch plate <b>676</b>), to accommodate the needs of the user. Furthermore, the user needs, and space available, may be the primary factors used to determine if a flexible element <b>679</b>, such as a cable, cord, telescoping tube, rod, bell crank, chain, or the like, will be utilized to help extract locking element <b>680</b> from releasable item <b>199</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It will be appreciated that the location of the looking and latching elements with respect to a cavity may be reversed; for example linear guidance mechanism <b>120</b> may be configured with one or lore cavities and a releasable item <b>199</b> may be configured with a latching assembly <b>660</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In various exemplary embodiments, multiple latching assemblies <b>660</b> may be utilized to couple a releasable item <b>199</b> to a linear guidance device <b>120</b>. For example, multiple latching assemblies <b>660</b> may be utilized for particularly large and/or heavy releasable items <b>199</b>. Additionally, due to space limitations, in certain exemplary embodiments multiple latching assemblies <b>660</b> may be employed for a releasable item <b>199</b> having a particular weight; however, in other exemplary embodiments wherein additional space is available, a single, larger latching assembly <b>660</b> may be employed for a releasable item <b>199</b> having that particular weight.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Moreover, multiple locking elements <b>680</b> may be utilized with a single inner latch plate <b>674</b> and/or outer latch plate <b>676</b>, to provide more shear force resistance than a single locking element <b>680</b> can provide. Additionally, where sufficient space is available for a lengthy latching assembly <b>660</b>, one latching assembly <b>660</b> may be utilized to secure and release locking elements in more than one releasable item <b>199</b>. If more than one releasable item <b>199</b> is to be released from a single linear guidance device <b>120</b>, multiple latching devices <b>660</b> may be disengaged either simultaneously or sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In various exemplary embodiments, outer latch plate <b>676</b> may be secured in place and then disengaged by any suitable means, for example via a cord with a cutter, an explosive fastener, an electrical latch, an electromechanical solenoid, a hydraulic or pneumatic activator, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In various exemplary embodiments, multiple releasable items <b>199</b> may be coupled to a single linear guidance device <b>120</b>. In these exemplary embodiments, each releasable item <b>199</b> may be releasably secured to the linear guidance device <b>120</b> via at least one latching device <b>660</b>. The releasable items <b>199</b> may be released simultaneously via operation of the respective latching devices <b>660</b>; alternatively, the releasable item <b>199</b> nearest the front of linear guidance device <b>120</b> may be released first, with subsequent releasable items <b>199</b> released after a delay (which may be adjustable and/or configurable) to enable the prior releasable item to separate from linear guidance device <b>120</b>.</p>
