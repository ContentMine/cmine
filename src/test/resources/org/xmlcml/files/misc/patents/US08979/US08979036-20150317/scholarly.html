      <p>Disclosed is a vertical rudder control system for an aircraft. The system is comprised
         of a rudder trim compensation generator that is configured to generate a rudder trim
         compensation order to set the position of the rudder bar of the aircraft to a neutral
         position in which the rudder bar is controlled with nil (i.e., zero) pilot effort.
         The vertical rudder control system includes a flight control calculator for calculating
         rudder control orders to maintain the nil effort rudder bar position, with the calculation
         of the rudder control orders being based on a sum of the rudder bar position, determined
         by a detection unit, and the rudder trim compensation order. The rudder control orders
         are received by a rudder operating unit, which is used to deflect the vertical rudder
         by a deflection value based on the rudder control orders.

         <h1>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a rudder control system for an aircraft, of an electrical
            type, with no mechanical rudder compensation.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Each aircraft is provided with a flight command system connecting the piloting units
            (stick, rudder bar) with the aerodynamic control surfaces (ailerons, spoilers, vertical
            rudder, pitch motivator) of the aircraft. Those systems have been developed over the
            time with the technical progress from purely mechanical non-assisted systems to electrical
            (command) systems being hydraulically assisted.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the first systems, the effort exerted by the pilot on the piloting units was integrally
            transmitted to the rudders and corresponded to the aerodynamic efforts. In order to
            minimize the muscular efforts, compensators or trims have been created to be able
            to vary the control surface position corresponding to a nil muscular effort from the
            pilot.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Over the technical evolutions, the trims have been essentially kept for operational
            needs (from the pilots). As on the present rudder control systems, there is no more
            mechanical connection between the rudder bar and the vertical rudder, the trim only
            serves to vary the nil effort position of the rudder bar.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Usually, a rudder control system for an aircraft, in particular for an airplane, of
            the electrical type, comprises:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>a rudder bar adapted to be operated by a pilot;</li>
                     
                     <li>means for detecting the position of the rudder bar and generating an electrical control
                        signal being representative of such position; and
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>a flight control calculator receiving such electrical control signal and generating,
                        with the help of the latter, control orders being transmitted to actuating means for
                        a vertical rudder of the aircraft.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0009">The vertical rudder is so called electrical, since the order controlled by the pilot
            (position of the rudder bar) is transmitted to the flight control calculator under
            the shape of an electrical signal. The calculator uses then such pilot order to determine,
            thru internal control laws, the control order being effectively applied to the vertical
            rudder.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0010">Despite such electrical characteristics, the rudder bar remains a complex mechanical
            unit. It especially comprises a spring assembly being able to create again an artificial
            sensation (as the rudder bar is not mechanically connected with the control surface
            of the aircraft anymore). Such artificial sensation generating means also comprise
            a mechanical rudder compensation or trim function. Such a function being implemented
            by a mechanical compensator or trim allows the pilot to control the nil effort rudder
            bar position. The control is carried out by the pilot thru buttons located in the
            cockpit.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0011">Such mechanical rudder trim meets several operational needs:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>in the case of an engine failure.</li>
                     
                     <li>The failure of an engine of the aircraft generates a yawing moment. Thus, in order
                        to keep an optimum flight line, the pilot must control a rudder bar order so that
                        the vertical rudder generates a corrective yawing moment being opposed to the moment
                        related to the engine failure.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>The constant application of such order obliges the pilot to exert a constant muscular
                        effort on the rudder bar. In order to enable the pilot to release the pedals while
                        keeping his position (and thus his order), he calls on the mechanical rudder trim
                        function.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>The use of such function allows the nil effort position (initially supposed to be
                        the neutral position) to be brought up to the current position of the rudder bar (required
                        by the pilot). Thus, the pilot may release the rudder bar while keeping the current
                        position; and
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>in the case of an airplane being twisted or asymmetrically loaded (fuel, passengers).</li>
                           
                        </ul>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>In those cases, the pilot can be in a position to ask for a constant slight rudder
                        order so as to cancel or to compensate for the dissymmetry (optimum sideslip, minimum
                        rudder clearance). To do so, the pilot may call on the mechanical rudder trim function.
                        Thus, the rudder bar can take a non nil order without the pilot operates on the pedals
                        (by a slight displacement of the nil effort point).
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0018">The presence, on an electrical rudder control system such as described above, of a
            mechanical rudder trim meeting the above mentioned needs, has some disadvantages,
            in particular in terms of mass, cost, installation, congestion, maintenance, overall
            reliability, etc.

            calculation means (or a flight control calculator) which use it to calculate the rudder

            control (that is to say to select hand operation) a compensation order which is transmitted
            to the calculation means.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0031">This second embodiment can be used in any situation of the aircraft requiring dissymmetry
