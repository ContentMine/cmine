      <p>This application is a continuation of PCT/US2010/050437, filed Sep. 27, 2010 and entitled
         “Gas Gun Launcher,” inventors John Hunter, Harry Cartland, Philip Sluder, and Richard
         Twogood, which claims priority to U.S. App. 61/277,544 and U.S. App. 61/277,543, each
         of which was filed Sep. 25, 2009. Each of the three preceding applications is incorporated
         by reference herein as if put forth in full below.

         <h1>TECHNICAL FIELD</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a gun which employs a heated gas to provide the initial
            acceleration for a projectile such as a missile which will subsequently produce initial
            acceleration by employing its own propulsion system, especially such projectiles that
            carry a payload into orbit.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND ART</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">An older version of a missile receiving initial acceleration from high-pressure air
            or another gas is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 3,583,277.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">United States patent application publication no. 20100212481 discloses “[a]n improved
            two-stage light gas gun for launching projectiles at high speeds. The gun consists
            of three tubes: the expansion, pump, and launch tubes. The expansion tube contains
            a close-fitting expansion piston that is propelled by an explosive charge. The expansion
            piston in turn drives the pump piston housed within the pump tube by means of a rod
            connecting the two pistons. The action of the pump piston adiabatically compresses
            and heats a light gas of hydrogen or helium, bursting a diaphragm at a predetermined
            pressure and expelling the projectile from the launch tube at a very high speed. This
            publication also quite well describes the prior art.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">And U.S. Pat. No. 7,775,148 provides, “Launching payloads at high velocity uses high-pressure
            gas or combustion products for propulsion, with injection of high pressure gas at
            intervals along the path behind the payload projectile as it accelerates along the
            barrel of the launcher. An inner barrel has an interior diameter equal to the projectile
            diameter or sabot containing the projectile. An outer casing surrounds the inner barrel.
            Structures at intervals attach the outer casing and the inner barrel. An axial gas
            containment chamber (AGC) stores high pressure gas between the inner barrel wall,
            the outer casing wall, and enclosure bulkheads. Pressure-activated valves along the
            barrel sequentially release the high pressure gas contained in the AGC in to the barrel
            to create a continuously refreshed high energy pressure heads behind the projectile
            as it moves down the barrel. A frangible cover at the exit end of the barrel allows
            the barrel to be evacuated prior to launch. The launcher is rapidly recyclable. The
            valves close automatically after the projectile has exited the barrel, allowing a
            new projectile to be introduced into the breech and the AGC to be recharged with high-pressure
            gas.”
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 7,775,148, moreover, for one embodiment states, “The elongated projectile
            launcher barrel is supported by flotation collars near breech and muzzle ends and
            is erected by flooding a flotation collar near the proximal end and submerging the
            breech end.”
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">And U.S. Pat. No. 6,116,136 uses recoil plates in an “actuated recoil absorbing mounting
            system” in order to “absorb the recoil energy from an underwater projectile launcher,
            such as a high discharge energy underwater gun.”
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">In none of the preceding patents or any other patent of which the inventors are aware
            are the barrels, or tubes, buoyant; is the launch tube isolated from the pump tube;
            or is there an automatic alignment system.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present inventors have developed a means of delivering supplies to earth lunar
            orbit in order to assist space exploration. The current method of delivering propellant,
            food and other supplies to orbit is with rocket delivery. Rocket delivery is extremely
            expensive with a typical cost of about $5,000 per lb of payload delivered. The requirement
            for approximately 9 km/s delta V to attain earth orbit when coupled with the rocket
            equation yields only a few percent payload fraction for rocket delivery. Their method
            uses a hydrogen gas gun to first boost a rocket to high speed. This allows a smaller
            more efficient rocket to deliver the payload to orbit. The payload fractions obtained
            are thereby much higher than obtained by a rocket alone. Their higher payload fractions
            plus the re-usable hydrogen gas gun reduce the payload delivery cost by more than
            a factor of 10.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present inventors have previously described using hydrogen gas guns to deliver
            payloads to orbit in the following published articles: “Livermore Proposes Light Gas
            Gun For Launch of Small Payloads”, 
            <i>Aviation Week and Space Technology</i>, Jul. 23, 1990, pp. 78-80; “Shooting Right For The Stars With One Gargantuan Gas

            High Altitude Research Project) launcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

         <h1>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The gas gun launcher of the present invention, principally to prevent a tension wave
            from proceeding along the launch tube and thereby degrading the accuracy of a launch,
            uses a sliding attachment of the launch tube to the pump tube with a sliding seal
            to retain the gas within the launch tube and the pump tube.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">A launch tube alignment system is preferably automatic, again to enhance the accuracy
            of launches.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">And an embodiment of the gas gun launcher suitable for use in water such as an ocean
            or large lake preferably utilizes a neutrally buoyant launch tube and a neutrally

         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">The current invention focuses on both land and ocean based hydrogen gas guns. Both

                        hydrogen. This is much cheaper, cleaner and safer than the gunpowder used to propel
                        the piston in a conventional two-stage hydrogen gas gun.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>4. Decouple the recoil from the launch tube thereby eradicating launch vibration and
                        allowing a lighter, lower inertia launch tube. Traditional gas guns have very heavy
                        thick walled launch tubes since they see extreme vibrations during the shot. The high
                        velocity nature of hydrogen gas guns demands a static launch tube during the shot.
                        Otherwise the vehicle will be damaged by the transverse g-loads as it traverses the
                        launch tube. Our pump tube slides backwards with a sliding seal between itself and
                        the launch tube thereby preventing launch tube recoil.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>5. Align the launch tube automatically. Launch tube alignment is critical for high
                        velocity guns and must be performed before every launch. It can be an onerous and
                        expensive task when performed by surveying crews. Automatic alignment will reduce
                        O&amp;M costs and save time.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>6. Have a fast opening valve that tailors the pressure profile at the projectile as
                        it traverses the barrel. This allows a lower peak G-load on the projectile. Typical
                        single stage gas guns have maximum pressure occurring near the breech and this causes
                        very high initial G-loads. Conversely two-stage piston driven gas guns have lower
                        peak pressures at the expense of a massive piston. The valve of the present invention
                        initially allows modest hydrogen release until the vehicle is a decent fraction (say
                        ⅓) of the way down the launch tube. The valve having opened more by then, allows the
                        peak pressure to occur.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>7. Have a fast closing muffler to capture the majority of the hydrogen and allow the
                        hydrogen to be recycled. This reduces launch costs and reduces muzzle blast as well.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>8. Have a mechanism to impart spin to the vehicle. The advantages to the vehicle include
                        greater flight stability, lower peak stress and heating and the ability to use a novel,
                        single thruster Attitude Control System (ACS).

         <p id="p-0016" num="0027">The Ocean Based Launcher (OBL) has unique objects and advantages that distinguish
            it from the LBL systems described here and in the references. The objects and advantages
            include:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>1. High mobility since the OBL may be towed and deployed in any preferred ocean including
                        international waters. Mobility results in flexibility compared to both standard rocket
                        systems and LBLs which are often constrained in launch inclination.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>2. Agility in azimuth and launch angle allows launch access to all orbital altitudes
                        and inclinations in the same day. For example a single OBL can launch several tons
                        to a propellant depot at equatorial azimuth, 25 degree launch angle and 500 km altitude
                        in the morning. It can then rotate to a 60 degree launch angle and deliver several
                        tons to a depot at a geosynchronous altitude and inclination later on the same day.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>3. Neutral buoyancy reduces launch tube gravitational sag to near zero. This means
                        the launch tube can be very straight and will require less adjustment and fewer stiffeners.
                        An extremely straight launch tube is paramount to minimize side loads on the launch
                        vehicle. Neutral buoyancy also means the system is much lighter, potentially cheaper
                        and more easily transported than an all steel system.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>4. Immunity to seismic activity. Some land-based systems may be located near regions
                        of earthquake activity and active faults. The OBL will be immune to seismic activity.
                        It will obviously have to deal with potentially energetic wave action. Tsunamis are
                        expected to be of small consequence since their amplitude is low in deep waters.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>5. Range safety is much easier since the launch location will be away from populated
                        areas with an ocean downrange.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>6. Hurricane avoidance is easily managed by deploying the OBL within 5 degrees of
                        the equator where hurricanes don't occur. (The Coriolis Force that organizes hurricanes
                        is proportional to the sine (Latitude).
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
               </li>

         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0034">The launch vehicle has the following objects and advantages:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>1. It has a sabot as shown in figref[FIG. 14]
                        	 that allows a larger working area for the hydrogen pressure. This gives the vehicle
                        greater velocity for a given hydrogen pressure.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>2. It has a sacrificial aero-spike at the nose to reduce the heat transfer on the
                        forward part of the vehicle. The aero-spike will ablate several inches during atmospheric
                        flight. The advantage is the aero-shell fore-body is substantially away from the high
                        speed air stagnation point at the aero-spike tip and hence will not heat and ablate
                        excessively.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>3. It preferably spins about the long axis thereby averaging out aerodynamic moments
                        and heating. This reduces peak bending forces and hot spots.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>4. It preferably has an Attitude Control System (ACS) that only requires one nozzle.
                        This works in conjunction with a spinning vehicle and an intelligent controller. The
                        advantage is a much lower part count and weight than a traditional ACS which usually
                        has multiple nozzles.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>5. It preferably has propellant tanks that can carry both the propellant and the payload.
                        This is because the payload is often rocket propellant such as LH
                        <sub>2</sub>, LOX or RPl, while the vehicle uses the same propellant. This will reduce the part
                        count and weight of the vehicle.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>6. It preferably has a plug nozzle. The advantage is a much shorter, compact nozzle
                        than a conventional central nozzle. This will increase ruggedness under the high G
                        launch loads. It will also allow for a more compact and lighter vehicle.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>7. It preferably has a centripetal fuel pump based on vehicle rotation. The rapidly
                        spinning vehicle can generate significant hydrostatic propellant pressures at the
                        periphery of the propellant tanks. Propellant can then be fed through a pressure regulator
                        to the plug nozzle. The advantage is in eliminating a turbo-pump or pressure bottle
                        that is ordinarily used to pressurize the propellant. This will save weight and reduce
                        cost.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>8. It preferably has liquid propellant comprised of an oxidizer and a fuel. One advantage
                        is no in-bore detonations in the event of vehicle break up in the launcher. Other
                        advantages include higher specific impulse as well as the ability to throttle thrust.

         <h1>MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0036" num="0061">A pump tube shown in figref[FIGS. 1]
            	, 
            <b>4</b>, 
            <b>8</b> and 
            <b>12</b> is comprised of flanged sections is made from steel tubing with high strength composite
            fiber overwrap. The thickness ratio of composite to steel is tailored to achieve neutral
            buoyancy. We note that typical composites have densities of about one fifth that of
            steel while they are very strong in tension. Since the composite is only strong in
            the fiber direction, one will typically employ a winding angle to give the tube both
            hoop strength as well as longitudinal strength. In our example case of 15 ksi internal
            pressure we used about six inches of Toray graphite composite wrapped around a 3 inch
            thick high strength steel tube, with a 100 inch ID. This recipe gives a safety factor
            of approximately 3 on yield assuming 15 ksi internal pressure.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0037" num="0062">The OBL preferentially uses the neutral buoyancy tubes submerged in the ocean to minimize
            gravitational loads and hence tube distortion. The LBL has the option to use composites
            as well and in this case benefits from the reduced weight, distortion and cost. The
            pump tube also has an insulating liner that reduces hydrogen heat transfer to the
            walls. The pump tube contains a heat exchanger that uses the heat of combustion of
            natural gas and air to heat hydrogen.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0038" num="0063">The pump tube has buoyancy compensators, in the case of the OBL, that also serve as
            recoil fins as in figref[FIG. 4]
            	. The compensators have sufficient area to dampen the pump tube recoil after a motion
            of several meters. There may be prior art regarding the recoil fins and if so we will
            use conventional shock absorbers that loosely couple the launch tube to the pump tube.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0039" num="0064">The pump tube has a gas manifold shown in figref[FIG. 4]
            	. The manifold has remote valves and sensors that allows for the addition of hydrogen
            as well as pulling a vacuum or purging with air or another gas. The manifold also
            admits natural gas and air destined for the heat exchanger and allows venting of the
            heat exchanger exhaust products. The heat exchanger is located in the bottom of the
            pump tube and the heated hydrogen will rise and have some stratification with the
            hottest hydrogen nearest the launch vehicle which is in the first section of launch
            tube. The stratification is beneficial since the high temperature and hence sound
            speed occurs nearest the vehicle where it will produce a higher speed than with no
            stratification.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0040" num="0065">A reusable high speed opening valve is located in the pump tube near the sliding seal
            in the launch tube as shown in figref[FIGS. 6 and 9]
            	. The valve diaphragm is initially clamped in the closed position by the force exerted
            by the radially oriented hydraulic pistons. When hydraulic pressure is released the
            diaphragm opens rapidly enough to allow the hydrogen to push the vehicle at high speeds
            down the launch tube. (Optional technology to the hydraulic pistons includes, but
            is not limited to, piezoelectric devices and squibs.) When the valve is initially
            opening, some hydrogen gas is released such that the vehicle accelerates yet doesn't
            see peak pressure until about ⅓ of the way down the launch tube. This reduces the
            peak stress on the vehicle. A sliding seal shown in figref[FIG. 6]
            	 is located between the opening valve and the launch tube on the OBL to retain the
            gas since the launch tube slides into the pump tube, rather than being connected to
            the pump tube, in order to decouple and thereby prevent a tension wave at launch from
            traveling to the launch tube and interfering with the accuracy of the launch when
            the pump tube recoils from the launch tube. Prevention of the tension wave in the
            OBL is further aided by the recoil fins/buoyancy compensators. The LBL can instead

            (see recoil absorber in figref[FIG. 12]
            	). If necessary, when the concrete structure is used as a shock absorber, the LBL
            pump tube can have a sliding seal similar to the OBL. Having a sliding connection
            and shock absorber system (recoil fins or recoil absorber), furthermore, aids in preventing

            works is the hydrogen acts on the rear edge to push it to the left. Upon the release
            of the fast valve piston brake (figref[FIG. 6]
            	) the item accelerates via Mdv/dt=P*A. The hydrogen starts to flow once the item has
            moved past the interior male part. The flow rate is set by the increasing flow area
            as well as the volume behind the projectile. There is a finite fill time for the hydrogen
            pressure to ramp up behind the projectile. Meanwhile as the hydrogen pressure is rising,
            the projectile starts to move and then one sees essentially unsteady 2-D gasdynamic

            type scrubber and back into the storage tanks where it preferably resides near 2,650
            psi and ambient temperature. While refilling the storage tanks the hydrogen temperature
            will increase adiabatically unless the tanks are cooled. The inventors expect this
            cooling can be accomplished, in the case of the OBL, with the surrounding seawater.
            The preceding is a standard industrial process, and there are hundreds of companies
            of ordinary skill in the art which can design and build the hydrogen scrubbing and
            recycling system.

         <p id="p-0081" num="0106">The vehicle emerges from the muffler and the sabot petals are lifted away from the
            aero-shell by aerodynamic forces. The petals burn, because of air friction due to
            the high speed of the vehicle, while airborne and land within a few km of the muffler.
            The vehicle is either spinning on exiting the launch tube or spins up in the atmosphere
            due to the subtly canted fins. Vehicle orientation changes are made if needed by driving
            gyroscopic precession. The angular precession rate is given by:

            <br></br>
            (Here torque is applied at right angles to the angular momentum axis. See “The Feynman
            Lectures on Physics” Vol. 1 Chapter 20, p. 6, Eqn. 20.15.)
            
         </p>
         <p id="p-0082" num="0107">The preferred ACS has a major novel feature in that it achieves orientation via stroboscopically
            applying thrust at right angle to the spin axis of the vehicle in accordance with
            Eqn. 2 above. This is important and different. Alternatively we can use conventional
            ACS thrust maneuvers which don't require a spinning vehicle, but they do require more
            thrusters. (Conventionally 2 thrusters for pitch and 2 for yaw located near the nose,
            as well as 2 for roll located near the center of mass.)

         <p id="p-0083" num="0108">Spinning the vehicle can be performed several ways. The fins will be very small canted
            protuberances on the aft section. They will not stick out more than say 5% of the
            vehicle diameter, and are expected to have a cant angle of 1 degree&lt;theta&lt;5 degrees.
            Their length can be 5-100% of the vehicle diameter. Optionally, grooves similarly
            oriented on the surface of the vehicle can be employed. And alternatively the inventors
            believe a practical technique is pre-spinning the vehicle in the launcher prior to
            launch by spinning the section of launch tube containing the vehicle is. The other
            option is to hone the barrel preferentially in one direction. Of the three techniques,
            pre-spinning the vehicle is likely the most precise. The fin option however, has a
            side benefit in that it will stabilize the projectile both gyroscopically as well
            as by moving the center of pressure aft of the center of gravity. All of these methods
            can be accomplished by one skilled in the art; however, significant engineering and
            testing will be required.

         <p id="p-0084" num="0109">Eqn. 2 is more transparent here: Dtheta=Dt*Force*(length to center of mass)/Angular
            momentum. Force being that applied by the ACS single thruster as it pulses. Sensors
            determine the orientation of the vehicle so that the microprocessor, or controller,
            can issue commands to achieve the desired orientation. Naturally there are other sensors
            on-board to determine where the vehicle is relative to the depot as well as the relative
            velocity etc. There are also the usual payload integrity sensors etc.

         <p id="p-0085" num="0110">As the vehicle ascends through the atmosphere, the aero-spike sees maximum heating
            and will ablate substantially. The rest of the aero-shell should remain largely undisturbed
            although the minimal fins may also get ablated somewhat. After attaining approximately
            60 to 100 km altitude the aero-shell will be ejected exposing the rocket motor and
            payload. Shortly thereafter, the rocket is ignited and burns for approximately 100
            seconds as it nears the orbital depot. The spinning rocket causes significant centripetal
            propellant pressure thereby, in the preferred embodiment, circumventing the need for
            a tank pressurization device or a turbo-pump. The ACS is in communication with the
            depot and continues to guide the spinning rocket/payload assembly as they approach
            the depot.
