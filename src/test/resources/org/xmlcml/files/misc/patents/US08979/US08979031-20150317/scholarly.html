      <p>An aerial delivery system is configured to allow delivery of one or more releasable
         items after the system is extracted from an aircraft. One or more linear guidance
         devices and releasable securing mechanisms allow the aerial delivery system to deploy
         one or more releasable items at an appropriate time. The releasable securing mechanisms
         may utilize one or more rotatable latch plates. The one or more releasable items may
         be deployed simultaneously, or in a staged or staggered fashion. Through use of drag
         or lift-producing devices, the system may be recovered and reused. The attitude and/or
         azimuth orientation of the system may be varied prior to, during, and/or after release
         of a releasable item.

         <h1>TECHNICAL FIELD</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to aerial delivery, particularly delivery achieved
            via mid-air extraction from an aircraft, and systems and methods related thereto.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aerial delivery is a term used to describe extracting an item from an aircraft in
            flight and then enabling a safe recovery of the item by use of an aerodynamic decelerator,
            which is most often a parachute system. Additionally, the aerial delivery operation
            is typically conducted from a cargo-type aircraft. The process may utilize very specific
            aerial delivery equipment and may adhere to very specific aerial delivery operational
            procedures. Often, the extracted item consists of an aerial delivery system containing
            cargo of some sort.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Two general types of extraction are utilized. Gravity extraction is the technique
            of using positive aircraft pitch angle, or by using some other force to cause the
            item to simply roll or slide out of the aircraft, which is typically followed by a
            parachute being deployed by a lanyard that is anchored to the aircraft. Parachute
            extraction is a technique whereby a parachute is first deployed out the rear of the
            cargo compartment, and the parachute is used to pull the item from the aircraft. Both
            techniques may conform to guidelines regarding length, weight, mass, etc., of the
            item being extracted in order to achieve a safe extraction operation. Generally speaking,
            relatively short and/or relatively lightweight items may be gravity extracted, but
            relatively long and/or relatively heavy items may preferably be parachute extracted,
            which removes the item from the aircraft quickly to prevent it from adversely affecting
            the aircraft's center of balance.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Items having a generally cylindrical shape, such as bombs that are powered by gravity,
            will typically be released from the belly or wing of a bomber or fighter aircraft.
            In practice, these items are released vertically but their longitudinal axis is substantially
            horizontal. Because the lower bomb racks in a bomb bay may be repositioned before
            other items can be released from racks above them, a simultaneous release of all items
            in the bomb bay cannot generally be conducted. The relatively long release time, coupled
            with a relatively high airspeed that is a feature of these aircraft, prevents the
            items from impacting in a concentrated area. Instead, the resulting impact path of
            the items is quite lengthy and the resulting impact effect is known as carpet bombing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">For aerial launching of chemical energy powered items, such as missiles, yet another
            technique is used. In this scenario, items are loaded into linear guidance devices,
            which are typically referred to as launchers. Typically, these launchers are either
            tubular or monorail (dovetail) in design, and are mounted substantially horizontally
            on fighter airplanes or helicopters. In practice, these items are generally powered
            by a self-contained rocket motor, allowing only one item to be loaded per launcher.
            Otherwise, the rocket blast from the front item could damage the item behind it, perhaps
            even causing it to explode while it is still in the launcher.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another scenario, the GBU-43/B Massive Ordinance Air Blast (“MOAB”) munition
            is secured in a cradle atop an aerial delivery system that is parachute extracted
            from the cargo compartment of a cargo aircraft. The MOAB cradle is just that—a cradle;
            and, because the MOAB is a winged item, it must be separated from its cradle immediately
            outside the aircraft, with the extraction parachute still attached to the aerial delivery
            system, before the cradle can pitch or roll significantly—otherwise, the MOAB is likely
            to be damaged or released in an undesirable attitude. In the separation process, the
            MOAB has forward momentum due to inertia imparted by the aircraft, but the aerial
            delivery system and cradle will slow significantly, due to drag created by the still
            attached extraction parachute. The aerial delivery system will also pitch, with its
            leading edge going downward due to gravity and aerodynamic forces. The combination
            of relative longitudinal motion and a pitch-down of the aerial delivery system and
            cradle, allow the platform and cradle to move down and rearward, away from the MOAB.
            However, because this separation technique does not provide linear guidance control,
            or roll and yaw control, relative to the cradle, the rear control surfaces of the
            MOAB must be in a retracted configuration until after the separation event has occurred.
            Even though this marginally controlled separation technique is acceptable for the
            MOAB, it may be unsuitable if the separation event were significantly delayed after
            the system has been released from the aircraft. Further, because the separation technique
            provides no directional control or roll and yaw control for the separating item, it
            may be unsuitable for launching items with extended rear-mounted control surfaces,
            such as fins. With no directional or roll and yaw control, it may also be unsuitable
            for simultaneously launching multiple items that have any type of extended control
            surfaces.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">An aerial delivery system enables delivery of releasable items after extraction from
            an aircraft. In an exemplary embodiment, an aerial delivery system comprises a first
            linear guidance device and a first releasable securing mechanism configured to couple
            a first releasable item to the first linear guidance device. The first releasable
            securing mechanism comprises a rotatable inner latch plate, a rotatable outer latch
            plate, and a locking element comprising a tapered pin. The tapered pin is insertable
            into the first releasable item. Responsive to rotation of the inner latch plate, the
            tapered pin is removable from the first releasable item. The aerial delivery system
            is extractable from an aircraft via a parachute.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another exemplary embodiment, a method of using an aerial delivery system comprises
            coupling a first releasable item to a first linear guidance device via a first releasable
            securing mechanism, and activating, during parachute-controlled descent of the aerial
            delivery system through the air, the first releasable securing mechanism to cause
            the first releasable item to separate from the aerial delivery system under the influence
            of the first linear guidance device. The first releasable securing mechanism comprises
            a rotatable inner latch plate, a rotatable outer latch plate, and a locking element
            insertable into the first releasable item.

         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, after being extracted from an aircraft,
            aerial delivery system

            device 
            <b>150</b>. With aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> stabilized in a generally vertical attitude, at least one releasable item

            delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may contain only one releasable item 
            <b>199</b>. In other exemplary embodiments, aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> contains multiple releasable items 
            <b>199</b>. A releasable item 
            <b>199</b> may be configured for any specific purpose. For example, releasable item 
            <b>199</b> could be a target for a tracking system; alternatively, releasable item 
            <b>199</b> could be a test vehicle, which could be allowed to free fall to obtain a desired
            velocity for parachute testing; further, releasable item 
            <b>199</b> could be a piece of ordnance too large to fit a conventional aircraft. Upon activation
            of releasable securing mechanism 
            <b>130</b>, gravity causes releasable item 
            <b>199</b> to separate from aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> under the influence of linear guidance device 
            <b>120</b>.

         <p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an exemplary embodiment, releasable item

            releasable item 
            <b>199</b> is steered, as “smart bombs” are steered. Further, a releasable item 
            <b>199</b> may be equipped with a ballistic or guided parachute system. Thus, if multiple releasable
            items 
            <b>199</b> are released, they may all land in one small area or, by using specific time intervals
            between releases and/or by using drag or lift-producing devices to slow the descent
            rate or to provide traversing capability of releasable items 
            <b>199</b>, multiple targets can be reached. Moreover, as discussed below, the attitude and/or
            azimuth of aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may be varied before and/or between releases in order to more effectively direct
            releasable items

         <p id="p-0044" num="0043">Multiple releasable items 
            <b>199</b> may be dropped individually, or they may be dropped simultaneously, or they may be
            released as any combination of the two. For example, successive individual releasable
            items 
            <b>199</b>, such as “bunker buster” bombs, may be released, each time-sequenced to arrive in
            a manner configured to form a successively deeper crater, and then multiple releasable

         </p>
         <p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, in accordance with various exemplary embodiments, because releasable items
            
            <b>199</b> are dependent on gravity to extract them from linear guidance device 
            <b>120</b>, multiple chemical propelled devices (such as missiles) can be accommodated by individual
            linear guidance devices 
            <b>120</b> (e.g., by delaying rocket motor ignition until each missile has separated from linear
            guidance device 
            <b>120</b>). Additionally, because aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> will have minimal airspeed once extracted from an aircraft, an entire group of releasable
            items 
            <b>199</b> may be released to impact in one concentrated area instead of having a typical carpet-bombing
            pattern, even if no guidance system is used. Further, release of one or more releasable
            items 
            <b>199</b> may be delayed for an extended period after aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> has been extracted from an aircraft. In various exemplary embodiments, release of
            a releasable item 
            <b>199</b> from aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may be delayed for a time between about five (5) seconds and one (1) minute after
            extraction of aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b>. However, release of a releasable item 
            <b>199</b> may be delayed any appropriate amount of time configured to achieve a desired delivery
            objective for releasable item 
            <b>199</b>.

         <p id="p-0046" num="0045">If aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> is to descend into hostile terrain, or into a combat zone, it may be preferable to
            allow aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> to simply land at a relatively high rate of descent under stabilization device 
            <b>150</b>. Alternatively, it may be preferable to release stabilization device 
            <b>150</b> in mid-air, causing aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> to crash, and allowing one or more components of aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> to be damaged or destroyed. For this purpose, a parachute release mechanism, such
            as the mechanism disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,264,205, may be suitably employed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0047" num="0046">However, aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may be expensive and, if conditions allow, it is very likely that a system user will
            desire to reuse aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> or a portion thereof. According to an exemplary embodiment, a release mechanism can
            be used to release stabilization device 
            <b>150</b> from aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b>. The departing stabilization device 
            <b>150</b> may then function as a pilot parachute to deploy a recovery device 
            <b>160</b>. Recovery device 
            <b>160</b> may also be deployed in any suitable manner known in the art.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, during descent of aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b>, it may be desirable to control the attitude of aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b>. For example, if a releasable item 
            <b>199</b> comprises a chemical-propelled rocket, it may be desirable to allow the rocket to
            be launched at a certain attitude (for example, at a 90 degree angle to the vertical,
            at a 135 degree angle to the vertical, and/or the like) rather than directly downward.
            Accordingly, the aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> of the present disclosure may be configured to support varied attitudes. With reference
            now to figref[FIGS. 2A-2D]
            	, and in accordance with various exemplary embodiments, aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may be configured to achieve various attitudes once deployed. For example, with reference
            now to figref[FIG. 2A]
            	, a generally rectangular aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may be suspended beneath a parachute 
            <b>220</b> via one or more slings 
            <b>210</b> coupled to aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> at locations 
            <b>210</b>A and 
            <b>210</b>B. Slings 
            <b>210</b> are of about equal length; thus, aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> is oriented substantially vertically.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0049" num="0048">However, the attitude of aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may be varied by changing the length of one or more slings 
            <b>210</b>. With reference now to figref[FIG. 2B]
            	, in an exemplary embodiment, aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> is coupled to one or more slings 
            <b>210</b> at locations 
            <b>210</b>A and 
            <b>2101</b>. As illustrated, the length of sling 
            <b>210</b> coupled to location 
            <b>210</b>B is shorter than the length of sling 
            <b>210</b> coupled to location 
            <b>210</b>A. Thus, due to the uneven sling length, aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> is oriented at least partially away from the vertical, as shown. In this manner,
            mid-air release of one or more releasable items 
            <b>199</b> at an angle away from vertical may be achieved. For example, when releasable item
            
            <b>199</b> is a chemical-propelled rocket, the rocket may be at least partially pointed toward
            a desired target, and thus post-release course corrections and other adjustments to
            the trajectory of releasable item 
            <b>199</b> can be reduced.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0050" num="0049">Moreover, the attitude of aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may also be varied by changing the location of one or more sling attachment fittings.
            With reference now to figref[FIG. 2C]
            	, in an exemplary embodiment, aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> is coupled to one or more slings 
            <b>210</b> at locations 
            <b>210</b>A and 
            <b>210</b>C. As illustrated, although the length of sling 
            <b>210</b> coupled to location 
            <b>210</b>A is about the same as the length of sling 
            <b>210</b> coupled to location 
            <b>2100</b>, aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> is oriented away from the vertical as a result of the placement of locations 
            <b>210</b>A and 
            <b>210</b>C. As before, mid-air release of one or more releasable items 
            <b>199</b> at an angle away from vertical may thus be achieved. Moreover, with further reference
            to figref[FIG. 2D]
            	, various sling mounting locations may be utilized to achieve a desired attitude of
            aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition to controlling, selecting, and/or otherwise modifying the attitude of
            aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b>, the azimuth of aerial delivery system can be controlled, selected, and/or otherwise
            modified in order to “point” aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> in a desired direction. For example, aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may be coupled to a guided parachute, and aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may thus be “pointed” via operation of the guided parachute. Moreover, aerial delivery
            system 
            <b>100</b> may also be configured to achieve a modified azimuth orientation when coupled to
            either a guided parachute or a non-guided parachute. For example, aerial delivery
            system 
            <b>100</b> may be further equipped with a rotating mechanism located between the payload portion
            of aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> and the parachute. In this manner, aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b> may be configured to achieve a particular azimuth orientation responsive to operation
            of the rotating mechanism. Such flexibility can be extremely valuable, for example,
            when orienting chemical-propelled rockets for eventual release and separation from
            aerial delivery system 
            <b>100</b>.

            <b>680</b> in shear, which can be very efficiently accomplished with a pin configured as a straight
            pin (a geometric right cylinder). However, a straight pin also typically uses a strong
