      <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>

         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to aggregate processing systems, rock crushing plants and other
            road building material processing systems. More specifically, this invention relates
            to mobile rock crushing and aggregate processing plants which are capable of being
            transported over public highways.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Several techniques and numerous equipment arrangements for moving rock crushing and
            aggregate processing plants from one location to another are known from the prior
            art. Particularly relevant to the present invention is the use of modular aggregate
            processing and systems where the components of the entire system can be broken down
            and transported via semi-trucks to another location. Typically, the modular aggregate
            processing and rock crushing system would be designed to be broken down in numerous
            trailerable independent units, including road building material handling and processing
            equipment, such as crushers, trommels, screens, etc. and material transport equipment
            such as conveyors, augers, etc.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">While such prior art modular mobile aggregate processing and rock crushing systems
            have enjoyed considerable success in the past, they do have some drawbacks. Such modular
            mobile aggregate processing and rock crushing system designs often resulted in considerable
            setup time and the use of many semi-tractors to pull all of the units.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">One prior art system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,935,587 issued to Brock et al.
            This patent describes a modular aggregate processing and rock crushing system which
            utilizes many trailers to transport the system. Inter-crusher/processing module conveyor
            trailers were used to interconnect the various crushing or processing stations.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consequently, a need remains in the industry for an improved modular mobile aggregate
            processing and rock crushing system which provides for reduced setup and delivery
            time and expense, as well as reduced space requirements (footprints) for the system
            itself.

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the invention is to provide a modular crushing system which requires
            reduced delivery and setup time and cost and reduced operating and fuel costs.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of moving road building
            material handling systems from one location to another with reduced setup time, reduced
            need for additional equipment to aid in the setup process and reduced expense.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other and further objects of the invention, together with the features of novelty
            appurtenant thereto, may appear in the detailed description and the drawings.

         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention comprises a road building material handling and aggregate processing
            system which utilizes no or reduced inter-crusher/screen/plant independent conveyor
            trailers.

         <p id="p-0077" num="0076">With the common output conveyor heights and the common feed point heights of the various
            components to the system, it is possible to customize a solution for a particular
            specification or application. For example, the mini plant of figref[FIG. 5]
            	 is enabled because of the common output and feed point heights across the various
            components. Control trailer 
            <b>700</b> is the central control and power source for the various components. In one embodiment,
            the control trailer 
            <b>700</b> may provide only control signals leaving the power supplying function to the generators
            
            <b>704</b> and 
            <b>706</b>. In another arrangement, control trailer 
            <b>700</b> could provide both. In still other embodiments, control trailer 
            <b>700</b> could provide power, as well as additional generators 
            <b>704</b> and 
            <b>706</b>. Power supply and control wires 
            <b>702</b> would connect the control trailer 
            <b>700</b> with the various components. Having a small footprint for the system allows for short
            power supply lines between the control trailer 
            <b>700</b> and the various other components. The shorter the power supply lines, the less resistance
            and the concomitant energy loss associated therewith. With less energy loss, a smaller
            generator can be used, thereby conserving fuel costs. Also, with shorter power supply
            lines, which are typically much larger than the lines that merely provide control
            signals, you get less weight and easier and quicker setup times. Alternatively, each
            component could have its own engine/generator system and could be connected together
            via a wired or wireless network.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0078" num="0077">It should be noted that the system of figref[FIGS. 6 and 7]
            	 does not have any stand-alone single purpose inter-plant conveyor trailers; i.e.,
            each conveyor in the system of the present invention is coupled to and combined with
            and transported as part of a function piece of equipment, which provides a function
            other than merely conveying material. The surge bin material transfer apparatus 
            <b>200</b> provides the function of buffering irregular flows by temporarily storing material
            exiting the bifurcatable crusher 
            <b>100</b> at times of high output flow. Additionally, in one embodiment, all of the inter-plant
            (between screen, crusher, and surge bin) conveyors used in the entire system are not
            configured to provide substantial vertical height adjustment of the discharge point.
            The use of such common discharge point heights from the various inter-plant conveyors
            enables faster setup times while preserving the ability to move the screens and crushers
            around to form different system configurations. One of the innovative methods of the
            present invention is to rearrange, add to, or omit from a first system, screens, crushers
            and surge bins, and thereby create a different combination without making any horizontal
            or vertical adjustments of the any discharge points of any inter-plant conveyors.
            The use of common discharge and common feed points for the various screens, crusher
            and surge bins allows for this to occur.

         <p id="p-0079" num="0078">The various screens, crushers, etc. are shown with wheels and tires thereon for providing

            	 and provides fewer stockpiling conveyors. In particular, there is shown a system
            comprising bifurcatable crusher 
            <b>100</b>, a scalping screen 
            <b>300</b> and a secondary cone crusher 
            <b>4000</b> and a control trailer 
            <b>700</b>. Screen plant exiting conveyor 
            <b>4300</b> provides material to the stockpiling conveyor 
            <b>4310</b>. Numerous other stockpiling conveyors are fed by similar exiting conveyors. The scalping
            screen 
            <b>300</b> has a returning output conveyor 
            <b>4200</b>, which provides an output with predetermined characteristics to the surge bin 
            <b>4100</b>, which feeds the cone crusher feed conveyor 
            <b>4400</b>, which delivers the material to the top opening of the cone crusher 
            <b>4500</b>, which then provides an output on conveyor 
            <b>4600</b> to an output conveyor on bifurcatable crusher 
            <b>100</b>, which then delivers the material directly to an input onboard conveyor for the scalping
            screen 
            <b>300</b>, where the material is screened a second time and delivered to the appropriate stockpiles.
            With the mini-plant, it may be necessary to give extra care to the rate and nature
            of material entering the bifurcatable crusher 
            <b>100</b>, as there is no surge capacity as is provided by the surge bin material transfer
            apparatus 
            <b>200</b> of figref[FIGS. 6 and 7]
            	. The mini plant does have a further advantage in that the power supply lines from
            the control trailer 
            <b>700</b> are shorter, thereby reducing energy loss related to electrical resistance, which
            increases with length of the power supply lines. The mini plant as shown in figref[FIG. 5]
            	 could be operated without additional generators, where the only source of power is
            the control trailer 
            <b>700</b>. The lack of independent conveyor trailers deployed in between the crushers and screens
            and the necessary space to maneuver such trailers is noticeable, especially with respect
            to the mini plant. However, in some embodiments, it is desired to leave space between
            the trailers sufficient to allow small skid steer-type loaders to gain access to areas
            where cleanup is needed. The present invention, with all conveyors being disposed
            onboard a trailer containing structure to perform a function additional to merely
            transporting the material, provides the ability for this small footprint. Additionally,
            in one embodiment, all of the inter-plant (between screen, crusher, and surge bin)
            conveyors used in the entire system are not configured to provide substantial vertical
            height adjustment of the discharge point. A surge bin material transfer apparatus
            
            <b>200</b> (figref[FIGS. 6 and 7]
            	) is understood to provide a buffering ability to accommodate substantial surges in
            output of a crusher or diminution in acceptance by a screen. Note that structure at
            the very end of a conveyor which helps to deflect material and provides only very
            minor buffering ability, such as the deflecting structure 
            <b>1907</b> (figref[FIG. 19]
            	), is considered herein and in the claims not to provide substantial buffering for
            surges. The multiple common feed point height and output conveyor heights allow for
            flexibility in configuring an aggregate processing system for a particular need.

            to achieve in a mobile aggregate crushing system. Often road builders will give a
            specification for base aggregate of having a maximum percentage of fines less than
            X inches. Often operators of rock crushers and aggregate processing systems would
            attempt to minimize the fines in the delivered road blend product. This minimization
            of the fines results in a higher level of less desirable rock. With this level of
            control, it provides the plant operator with the ability to include a controlled amount
            of fines (just under the limit of the road blend specification) instead of building
            a larger stockpile of waste rock. This notion of transforming otherwise waste rock
            into usable material results in increased profits for the plant.

         </p>
         <p id="p-0100" num="0099">Material is output from a source of material, either overs, fines or a previously
            blended combination of the same. The material goes through a material entry top chute
            
            <b>1502</b> and drops upon the sliding swing gate blending assembly 
            <b>1500</b>. Depending upon the positioning under the material entry top chute 
            <b>1502</b> of the slide assembly (which comprises sliding fixed backflow inclined directing
            plate 
            <b>1506</b>, sliding fixed forward flow inclined directing plate 
            <b>1510</b> and sliding swing gate 
            <b>1512</b>), the material will flow in some set percentage to either the forward flow exit chute
            
            <b>1520</b> or the backward flow exit chute 
            <b>1522</b>. If a different mix of percentages is desired, then the slide assembly of sliding
            fixed backflow directing plate 
            <b>1506</b>, sliding swing gate 
            <b>1512</b> and sliding fixed forward flow directing plate 
            <b>1510</b>, can be slid one way or the other to make an infinitely variable diversion of material
            through the sliding swing gate blending assembly 
            <b>1500</b>. While the sliding swing gate blending assembly 
            <b>1500</b> is capable of infinite variability, it should be understood that the variations are
            not necessarily continuous. To go from a mixture with 47% forward, then to 49% forward,
            and finally to a mixture of 51% going forward, requires more than a continuation of
            the movement which resulted in an increase from 47% to 49%. The process would involve
            both flipping the sliding swing gate 
            <b>1512</b> and sliding the same gate nearly completely to one side of the space under material
            entry top chute 
            <b>1502</b>; i.e., either minimizing or maximizing the gap between sliding swing gate forward
            side limit plate 
            <b>1516</b> and end plate 
            <b>1556</b>.

         <p id="p-0101" num="0100">It is believed that the combination of a sliding and swing gate provide for the ability
            to have a fully adjustable flow while reducing the vertical height of the apparatus
            to selectively divert flow. The small vertical height of sliding swing gate blending
            assembly 
            <b>1500</b> allows for the more sliding swing gate blending assemblies 
            <b>1500</b> to be stacked within the area below the output of the various screens of scalping
            screen 
            <b>300</b>. Therefore, this novel component provides for increased compactness of the scalping
            screen 
            <b>300</b> with a high degree of blending controls.
