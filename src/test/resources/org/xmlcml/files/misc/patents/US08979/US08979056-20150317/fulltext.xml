<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter disclosed herein relates to aircraft environmental control. More specifically, the subject disclosure relates to a support bracket of a cabin air compressor for an aircraft environmental control system.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Environmental control systems (ECSs) are utilized on various types of aircraft for several purposes, such as in cooling systems for the aircraft. For example, components of an ECS may be utilized to remove heat from various aircraft lubrication and electrical systems and/or used to condition aircraft cabin air. A cabin air conditioning and temperature control system (CACTCS) is an example of an aircraft ECS that includes air cycle packs supplied with pressurized outside (fresh) air from electric motor-driven cabin air compressors (CACs) which condition fresh air for cabin heating and cooling. The CACTCS provides flow control for modulation of cooling pack air flow, recirculation fans to circulate cabin air, and associated valves and sensors used for system control.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The CACTCS may also include a trim air system to provide individual cabin zone temperature control. This includes trim temperature control valves, trim duct heaters and associated sensors. As one example, a CACTCS may provide control of six baseline passenger zones and a flight deck zone. Additional zones, such as a forward cargo zone, a crew zone and/or an attendant zone may be controlled by other ECSs. Recirculation fans may also be provided for additional air flow to the passenger cabin and to ensure that flow at an air distribution nozzle remains constant.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various elements of aircraft ECSs can experience harsh environments including a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and vibrations. Elements of aircraft ECSs must also fit within a compact space and minimize weight while providing adequate strength to handle typical and peak stresses over the anticipated life of the elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect, a support bracket for a cabin air compressor assembly is provided. The support bracket includes a cabin air compressor mounting portion formed substantially orthogonal to an access portion and a structural support portion. A cross-support bracket mounting portion is formed at an angle relative to the access portion. An upper lug portion is formed at an angle relative to the access portion and substantially orthogonal to an upper lug. A plurality of cabin air compressor mounting holes is formed in the cabin air compressor mounting portion. The cabin air compressor mounting holes are distributed in an arc configuration along a cabin air compressor mounting hole circle radius. A plurality of lower slotted holes and an upper slotted hole are formed in the cross-support bracket mounting portion. A ratio of a length of longitudinal offset defined between the lower slotted holes and the upper slotted hole to a length of lateral offset between a center of at least one of the lower slotted holes and the upper slotted hole is between 2.47 and 2.91.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect, a cabin air compressor support assembly is provided. The cabin air compressor support assembly includes a left-hand cabin air compressor support bracket coupled to a cabin air compressor assembly, a cross-support bracket, and an upper three-way mount. The cabin air compressor support assembly also includes a right-hand cabin air compressor support bracket coupled to the cabin air compressor assembly, the cross-support bracket, and a lower three-way mount. The right-hand cabin air compressor support bracket includes a cabin air compressor mounting portion formed substantially orthogonal to an access portion and a structural support portion. A cross-support bracket mounting portion is formed at an angle relative to the access portion. An upper lug portion is formed at an angle relative to the access portion and substantially orthogonal to an upper lug. A plurality of cabin air compressor mounting holes is formed in the cabin air compressor mounting portion. The cabin air compressor mounting holes are distributed in an arc configuration along a cabin air compressor mounting hole circle radius.

A ratio of a length of longitudinal offset defined between the lower slotted holes and the upper slotted hole to a length of lateral offset between a center of at least one of the lower slotted holes and the upper slotted hole is between 2.47 and 2.91.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a further aspect, a method of installing a support bracket in a cabin air conditioning and temperature control system is provided. An upper lug of the support bracket is coupled to a mount of the cabin air conditioning and temperature control system. A cabin air compressor mounting portion of the support bracket is coupled to a cabin air compressor assembly of the cabin air conditioning and temperature control system. A cross-support bracket mounting portion of the support bracket is coupled to a cross-support bracket. The support bracket includes the cabin air compressor mounting portion formed substantially orthogonal to an access portion and a structural support portion. The cross-support bracket mounting portion is formed at an angle relative to the access portion.
