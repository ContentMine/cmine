      <p>A tripod head panel device of a tripod head comprises a tripod head panel and a removably
         mounted snap-fit plate. The tripod head panel comprises a fixed plate, a moveable
         plate mounted underneath the fixed plate, and a driving plate mounted underneath the
         moveable plate. The fixed plate comprises a supporting base plate and a first retaining
         wall protruding upward from the supporting base plate. The moveable plate comprises
         a supporting base plate and a second retaining wall protruding upward from the supporting
         base plate, with a driving hole provided in the center of the moveable plate. The
         driving plate comprises a base mounted underneath the moveable plate and a handle
         extending from an end of the base, with an offset cam inside the driving hole formed
         on the seat. The snap-fit plate is mounted on the supporting base plate between the
         first and the second retaining walls.

      <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
      
      <div>
         <h1>FIELD</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to photographic equipment, in particular, to a panel
            device of a tripod head.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Both amateur photographers and professional photographers are eager to quickly, accurately,
            and stably fix a camera or video camera onto a tripod, so as to shoot those passing
            pictures or images.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">To achieve the above, people have to use expensive tripods that have tripod heads
            with very complex structures. Meanwhile, installation of the camera or video camera
            onto the tripod head and the subsequent adjustments are very complicated. After finishing
            the adjustments, the photographer may have missed a good opportunity to capture a
            great image.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, to overcome the above deficiencies, there is an urgent need for a reliable
            tripod head panel device that is simple in structure and is quick to install.
         </p>
      </div>

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed herein is a panel device of a tripod head.</p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to at least one embodiment, a tripod head panel device includes a tripod
            head panel and a snap-fit plate removably mounted on the tripod head panel. The tripod
            head panel includes a fixed plate, a moveable plate mounted underneath the fixed plate,
            and a driving plate mounted underneath the moveable plate. The fixed plate includes
            a supporting base plate and a first retaining wall protruding upward from the supporting
            base plate. The moveable plate includes a supporting base plate and a second retaining
            wall protruding upward from the supporting base plate of the moveable plate. The moveable
            plate is provided with a driving hole. The driving plate includes a base mounted underneath
            the moveable plate and a handle extending from an end of the base, while an eccentric
            cam formed on the seat is provided inside the driving hole. The snap-fit plate is
            mounted on the supporting base plate of the moveable plate, and is provided between
            the first and the second retaining walls.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The tripod head panel device described herein is simple in structure, quick to install,
            and is reliable. Therefore, it is easy to fix a camera or other equipment onto the
            tripod head panel.

         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">The operation principle of the tripod head

            <b>102</b> and the movable plate 
            <b>104</b> is the smallest. When turning the driving plate 
            <b>106</b> along direction II, the eccentric cam

            <b>10446</b>. At the moment, the snap-fit plate

            <b>104</b> to become closer to the fixed plate 
            <b>102</b>. At the moment, the snap-fit plate
