<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A venting system (<b>10</b>) in an aircraft (<b>12</b>), where the aircraft (<b>12</b>) is substantially symmetrical about a midline (<b>14</b>), has a pair of wings (<b>16</b> and <b>18</b>) extending outwardly on respective sides of the midline (<b>14</b>), a center fuel tank (<b>20</b>), a surge tank (<b>22</b> and <b>24</b>) at outer ends of each wing (<b>16</b> and <b>18</b>), and optionally one or more wing fuel tanks (<b>26</b> and <b>28</b>) interposed between the center fuel tank (<b>20</b>) and the respective surge tank (<b>22</b> or <b>24</b>). The venting system (<b>10</b>) for the center fuel tank (<b>20</b>) includes a main vent line (<b>30</b>) that extends across the midline (<b>14</b>) to vent openings (<b>32</b> and <b>34</b>) communicating with respective surge tanks (<b>22</b> and <b>24</b>). The main vent line (<b>30</b>) forms a linear flow path for fluid, generally air, flowing between opposite ends of the vent line (<b>30</b>). The venting system (<b>10</b>) also includes a branch vent line (<b>36</b> and <b>38</b>) extending from the main vent line (<b>30</b>) and opening on the center fuel tank (<b>20</b>). The branch line has at least one fuel tank opening (<b>40</b> and <b>42</b>) on each side of the midline (<b>14</b>).</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a fuel tank venting system for an aircraft, and more particularly, to the distribution architecture for an aircraft fuel tank venting system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An aircraft often has fuel tanks located in internal cavities in the aircraft's wings. The empty space in the fuel tanks that is not filled with fuel typically is a mixture of air and fuel vapor, and is referred to as ullage. To protect against fuel tank explosions, potentially combustible mixture of fuel vapor and air in the ullage space is replaced or diluted with an inert gas, such as nitrogen enriched air (NEA), to reduce the oxygen content in the ullage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The fuel tanks generally are vented to the atmosphere to accommodate pressure changes with altitude during flight, thereby reducing the required strength, and thus weight, of the fuel tanks. While climbing, for example, the ambient pressure decreases as altitude increases. As a result, ullage gas in the fuel tank may be vented overboard to maintain pressure equilibrium or a specified pressure differential between the tank and the outside environment. The venting system typically vents the fuel tanks through a surge tank (an overflow tank that prevents unwanted ejection of fuel from the aircraft) located near a tip of the wing. The surge tank is provided with means for venting to atmosphere, and typically also includes means for draining fuel from the surge tank back to the fuel tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Likewise, as an aircraft descends, the ambient pressure increases as the altitude decreases. Consequently, there may be a large inrush of ambient air into the ullage space during the descent. This is particularly true for an airplane with an open fuel tank vent, which is common on most commercial aircraft. Atmospheric air generally has about 21% oxygen content, so introduction of atmospheric air into the ullage space dilutes or spoils the inertness of the ullage. The inrush of atmospheric air can quickly raise the oxygen concentration in the ullage, which increases the combustion risk.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, frequently the pressure on the outlet of the venting system on one side of the aircraft will differ from the pressure on the other side of the aircraft. In a system with cross-venting, this may create a flow of gas that is large in magnitude through the venting system. If the center tank ullage is within this flow path, it must be assumed that this high magnitude of ambient air has polluted the air within the center tank and increased the oxygen concentration in the center tank ullage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One way to address some of these problems is to provide a mixing chamber with a partition to prevent or minimize continuous flow from one side of the aircraft to the other and intermingling of air in the venting system through the ullage of the center fuel tank. U.S. Pat. No. 7,621,483 discloses such a mixing chamber.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In contrast to systems employing mixing chambers where the flow through the mixing chamber is other than linear, the present invention provides a fuel tank venting system for an aircraft that provides for linear flow through a main vent line and reduces the potential for atmospheric air to travel through a flow circuit that includes the ullage space in the center fuel tank.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">More particularly, the present invention provides a venting system in an aircraft, where the aircraft is substantially symmetrical about a midline, has a pair of wings extending outwardly on respective sides of the midline, a center fuel tank, a surge tank at outer ends of each wing, and optionally one or more wing fuel tanks interposed between the center fuel tank and the respective surge tank. The venting system for the center fuel tank includes a main vent line that extends across the midline to vent openings communicating with respective surge tanks. The surge tanks typically are vented to atmosphere. The main vent line forms a linear flow path for fluid, generally air, flowing between opposite ends of the vent line. The venting system also includes a branch vent line extending from the main vent line and opening on the center fuel tank. The branch line has at least one fuel tank opening on each side of the midline.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention provides an anti-cross flow fuel tank venting system for an aircraft that reduces the potential for atmospheric air to travel through a flow circuit that includes the ullage space in the center fuel tank. To minimize potential flammability and explosion risks, an inert gas, typically nitrogen-enriched air (NEA), is injected into the ullage space in the fuel tank through a distribution network. The venting system, which is separate from the NEA distribution network, is designed to relieve excess pressure differentials as the plane changes altitude or due to other events, such as during refueling.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The anti cross-venting architecture provided by the present invention also prevents or minimizes contamination of the ullage in the center tank in cross-venting conditions, where a pressure difference exists between the openings to atmosphere on opposite sides of the aircraft venting system. The system provided by the invention does so without adding any moving parts or the complexity of bifurcated inlets, or left/right vent isolation, yet still allows the implementation of a symmetric or near symmetric venting system while maintaining dual redundancy, specifically vent path redundancy. This is accomplished by limiting the pressure loss between the points at which the center tank vent lines branch off from the main vent line. The pressure loss at the points at which the center tank vent lines branch off the main vent line is much less than the pressure loss of any potential flow circuit through the center tank. In other words, the difference between (a) the pressure drop across the points where the branch vent lines branch off the main vent line, is much less than (b) the pressure drop across a circuit that includes the center fuel tank, from a first point where a branch line branches off the main vent line, through an outlet into the center fuel tank, through the ullage in the center fuel tank, and back to the main vent line. This difference in pressure drops causes most of the cross-flow air in the main vent line to remain in the main vent line, thereby minimizing the amount of air flow that would make use of the center tank flow path and consequently minimizing the dilution of the fuel tank ullage.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to the drawings in detail, and initially <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention provides an anti-cross flow fuel tank venting system <b>10</b> in an aircraft <b>12</b>. The aircraft <b>12</b> is substantially symmetrical about a midline <b>14</b>, has a pair of wings <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> extending outwardly on respective sides of the midline <b>14</b>, a center fuel tank <b>20</b>, a surge tank <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> at outer ends of each wing <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, respectively, and optionally one or more wing fuel tanks <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> interposed between the center fuel tank <b>20</b> and the respective surge tank <b>22</b> or <b>24</b>. The surge tanks <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> typically are vented to atmosphere and includes means, such as a pump, for returning any fuel that enters the surge tank <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> back to a fuel tank <b>20</b> or <b>26</b> or <b>28</b>. In a delta- or single-wing aircraft, the left wing and the right wing are not separated by a fuselage, but present a continuous lifting surface across the midline. For purposes of the invention, the lifting surfaces on either side of the midline will be considered separate wings.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The venting system <b>10</b> for the center fuel tank <b>20</b> includes a main vent line <b>30</b> that extends across the midline <b>14</b> to vent openings <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> communicating with respective surge tanks <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The main vent line <b>30</b> provides redundant venting options, to the left and right surge tanks <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, while relieving pressure differentials between the left and right surge tanks <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, all without spoiling the ullage. These dual openings <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> from the main vent line <b>30</b> provide redundancy, so that if the main vent line <b>30</b> is blocked on one side of the midline <b>14</b>, the center fuel tank <b>20</b> still has access to the opening <b>32</b> or <b>34</b> on the other side. The main vent line <b>30</b> preferably only vents the center fuel tank <b>20</b>. The main vent line <b>30</b> forms a linear flow path for fluid flowing between the surge tank vent openings <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> on opposite ends of the main vent line <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The main vent line <b>30</b> generally has a substantially constant inside diameter over it length, and can be formed by pipe, conduit or other tubular construction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The venting system <b>10</b> also includes one or more branch vent lines extending from the main vent line <b>30</b> into the center fuel tank <b>20</b>. The branch vent line or lines include at least two fuel tank openings, at least one on each side of the midline <b>14</b>. The branch vent lines typically are constructed in a similar manner as the main vent line <b>30</b>, and typically have the same inside diameter. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two vent lines <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> branch from a common point on the main vent line <b>30</b>. In other words, the branch vent line includes first and second branch lines <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> that diverge in a V-shape, in a symmetrical or a mirror image about the midline <b>14</b>, from the main vent line <b>30</b> toward the outlet fuel tank openings <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A venting system that is symmetrical or near-symmetrical within the center fuel tank <b>20</b>, a mirror image about the midline <b>14</b>, is preferred. A symmetrical vent system allows for a lower weight venting solution, and if the venting system is not symmetrical, the tuning of the NEA distribution system is more complex.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Variations on the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are contemplated within the scope of the present invention. Another symmetrical arrangement is shown in the venting system <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Once again, a branch vent line <b>52</b> connects to the main vent line <b>30</b> at a single location. In this system <b>50</b>, a first branch line <b>52</b> extends from a main vent line <b>30</b>, and that first branch line <b>52</b> further divides into first and second branch lines <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> that lead to respective fuel tank openings <b>57</b> and <b>58</b> in the center fuel tank <b>20</b>. Also note that the main vent line <b>30</b> defines a flow path that extends in a substantially straight line where the main vent line <b>30</b> passes through the center fuel tank <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the venting system <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the branch vent line <b>62</b> again branches from the main vent line <b>30</b> at a single location, and then forms a continuous loop, with multiple, in this case four, fuel tank openings <b>64</b>, <b>65</b>, <b>66</b>, and <b>67</b> spaced along the looped branch vent line <b>62</b>, with two fuel tank openings on either side of the midline <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this embodiment, the venting system <b>70</b> has a branch line that includes both a first branch line <b>72</b> and a second branch line <b>74</b> on opposite sides of the midline <b>14</b>. The first branch line <b>72</b> and the second branch line <b>74</b> are connected to the main vent line <b>30</b> at spaced apart locations, each branch line <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> extending to respective fuel tank openings <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> in the center fuel tank <b>20</b> from the main vent line <b>30</b>. A distance between the locations where the first branch line <b>72</b> and the second branch line <b>74</b> connect to the main vent line <b>30</b> is less than a distance between locations where the first and second branch lines <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> connect to the main vent line <b>30</b> and a nearest outlet opening <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>. The branch vent line further includes a third branch line <b>79</b> spaced from the main vent line <b>30</b> that connects the first and second branch lines <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>, thereby providing another pathway to respective left and right fuel tank openings <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>. To minimize cross-venting, the distance between the points where the first and second branch vent lines <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> branch from the main vent line should be minimized, thereby approximating a single vent line. In practice, to maintain redundancy in the event of a blockage of one branch line <b>72</b> or <b>74</b> or one side of the main vent line <b>30</b>, that distance generally should be no more than approximately two to six times the diameter of the branch vent lines <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">All of the embodiments shown to this point have been symmetrical about the midline of the aircraft, but that is not necessarily the case in every embodiment. An example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Here again, the venting system <b>80</b> has a branch line that includes both a first branch line <b>82</b> and a second branch line <b>84</b> on opposite sides of the midline <b>14</b>. The first branch line <b>82</b> and the second branch line <b>84</b> are connected to the main vent line <b>30</b> at spaced apart locations, each branch line <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> extending to respective fuel tank openings <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> in the center fuel tank <b>20</b> from the main vent line <b>30</b>. A distance between the locations where the first branch line <b>82</b> and the second branch line <b>84</b> connect to the main vent line <b>30</b> is less than a distance between locations where the first and second branch lines <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> connect to the main vent line <b>30</b> and a respective outlet opening <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>. But in this case, the branch lines <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> are not symmetrical about the midline <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Finally, a more complex venting system <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this embodiment, the system <b>100</b> has multiple branch lines, specifically three branch lines <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b>, branching from the main vent line <b>30</b> at spaced locations, symmetrically relative to the midline <b>14</b>. One branch line <b>102</b> has a single outlet opening <b>108</b> on the midline <b>14</b>. The other two branch lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> have multiple outlet openings. Each of these branch lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> have two openings <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>116</b> spaced from each other. All of the vent openings <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>116</b> are spaced about the center fuel tank <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In summary, the present invention provides a venting system <b>10</b> in an aircraft <b>12</b>, where the aircraft <b>12</b> is substantially symmetrical about a midline <b>14</b>, has a pair of wings <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> extending outwardly on respective sides of the midline <b>14</b>, a center fuel tank <b>20</b>, a surge tank <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> at outer ends of each wing <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, and optionally one or more wing fuel tanks <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> interposed between the center fuel tank <b>20</b> and the respective surge tank <b>22</b> or <b>24</b>. The venting system <b>10</b> for the center fuel tank <b>20</b> includes a main vent line <b>30</b> that extends across the midline <b>14</b> to vent openings <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> communicating with respective surge tanks <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The main vent line <b>30</b> forms a linear flow path for fluid, generally air, flowing between opposite ends of the vent line <b>30</b>. The venting system <b>10</b> also includes a branch vent line <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> extending from the main vent line <b>30</b> and opening on the center fuel tank <b>20</b>. The branch line has at least one fuel tank opening <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> on each side of the midline <b>14</b>.</p>
