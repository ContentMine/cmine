      <p>To reduce sound emission and at the same time improve stability, a multilayer board
         for acoustic insulation is proposed that includes, but is not limited to a core sheet
         arranged between a first and a second covering layer. At least one of the two covering
         layers is of a closed design. The core sheet is firmly connected in a planar fashion
         to the covering layers. The core sheet comprises slits that extend within the core
         sheet in the direction of the core sheet thickness, which slits reduce the shear stiffness
         of the board and thus ensure an improved acoustic insulation effect. On both sides
         the core sheet comprises continuous edge zones, which extend parallel to the covering
         layers. An aircraft can have an interior lining formed by panels that comprise the
         multilayer boards in order to provide acoustic insulation.

            a method for producing said board. The invention relates in particular also to an

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">For the purpose of providing acoustic insulation, panel-shaped components are known
            that are designed in such a manner that as efficient as possible a reduction in sound
            emission is achieved. To reduce sound, for example, multilayer boards are used which,
            to put it in a simplified manner, comprise three layers, wherein the middle layer
            is designed with a view to acoustic insulation, while the two exterior layers assume
            other functions, for example the visual finish of a multilayer board used as a wall
            panel. It is, for example, known to design the middle layer with open slits that have
            been placed perpendicularly to the face, for example slits that are arranged in a
            cruciform manner, so that, based on the relatively large slits, sound emission is
            reduced. However, it has also been shown that this results in impeding the mechanical
            stability of the multilayer board. In order to provide a multilayer board with increased
            mechanical stability, a multilayer board is, for example, known from DE 10 2007 022
            616 B3, in which the core layer comprises so-called oblique slits, in which multilayer
            board, when it is subjected to force from the slit side, the oblique slits essentially
            close up immediately and thus in the case of load application an essentially compact,
            coherent core layer results that behaves in a manner that is similar to the behavior
            of a solid core layer with no slits. However, it has been shown that as a result of
            this the breaking load of the panels is reduced when a load is applied from the direction
            of the side without slits.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">It may be an object of the invention to provide a multilayer board with reduced sound
            emission and improved stability.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an exemplary embodiment a multilayer board for acoustic insulation is provided,
            which multilayer board comprises a core sheet, a first covering layer and a second
            covering layer, wherein at least one of the two covering layers is of a closed design.
            The core sheet is, furthermore, arranged between the first covering layer and the
            second covering layer and is firmly connected in a planar fashion to the covering
            layers. Moreover, the core sheet comprises slits. According to the invention it is
            provided for the slits to extend within the core sheet in the direction of the standard
            plane of the panel or the core sheet thickness, and for the core sheet on both sides
            to comprise continuous edge zones that extend parallel to the covering layers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a result of this, multilayer boards for acoustic insulation can be provided that
            comprise improved breaking load behavior, because in those regions of the board, in
            which during any area load or concentrated load that is experienced the highest tension
            forces and compression forces can occur, there are no interruptions in the form of
            slits. In other words, the transition region between the core material and the covering
            layers is not interrupted by slits, so that in these regions, which are most severely
            subjected to loads, optimum force transmission can take place. There is a further
            advantage in the multilayer board according to the invention in that the improved
            stability is provided irrespective of the direction of the load, in other words irrespective
            of whether the load is experienced from the front or from the rear. However, at the
            same time, the slits within the core sheet also ensure that the panel, in other words
            the multilayer board, provides improved acoustic characteristics when compared to
            a board with a core sheet without slits.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The acoustic effectiveness is, among other things, due to the fact that in the case
            of multilayer boards so-called lateral flexural waves can occur in the low frequency
            range, wherein their velocity is characterized by the overall flexural rigidity of
            the respective multilayer board. The following phenomena can be distinguished in relation
            to different frequencies. During an increase in the frequency, a slow transition of
            the lateral flexural wave to a so-called lateral shear wave occurs, wherein its propagation
            velocity increases proportionally to the root of the core-sheet shear modulus, irrespective
            of the frequency. During a further increase in the frequency, a transition from the
            lateral shear wave to a lateral flexural wave occurs, wherein its propagation velocity
            is defined by the flexural rigidity of the covering layers of the multilayer boards.
            In theory it is imaginable for the shear modulus of the core sheet to be selected
            in such a manner that within the frequency range under consideration the lateral waves
            remain below the speed of sound in air. In this case the board emits sound only very
            ineffectively. In practical application different parameters can be varied, for example
            the thickness of the core sheet, the thickness of the covering layers, their modulus
            of elasticity, as well as the thickness of the covering layers and of the core sheet.
            With corresponding attuning of the parameters to each other, a multilayer board providing
            improved acoustic behavior can be provided. By setting the various parameters the
            flexural rigidity of the multilayer board relative to a state without external mechanical
            loads is not influenced. In order to achieve effective acoustic insulation, the shear
            stiffness of the core sheet must be reduced, because in terms of physical aspects
            said shear stiffness is directly proportional to the shear modulus of the core sheet.
            In order to reduce the shear stiffness of the core sheet, the already mentioned slits
            in the core sheet are provided. However, the slits are at the same time associated
            with a reduction in the mechanical stiffness and in the breaking load.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">By the inventive arrangement of the slits within the core sheet, the effects on the
            breaking load can be reduced to a minimum, because in this region the so-called neutral
            phase is arranged, i.e., the region in which, when a load acts on the area, neutralization
            of the tension forces that are encountered as a result of the flexural moment on the
            side facing away from the force transmission occurs, and neutralization of the compression
            forces on the side facing the force transmission occurs. In other words, in the region
            of the neutral phase the core layer assumes the task of keeping the compression region
            spaced apart from the tension region, in other words keeping spaced apart the two
            exterior lateral surfaces of the board.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment the multilayer board is provided for acoustic insulation in
            an aircraft, in particular in an airplane.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">Forming the core sheets and covering layers may take place with the use of materials
            that are commonly used in aircraft construction, in particular in airplane construction,
            and in these fields above all in the interior construction of the airplane. This aspect
            is generally-speaking of fundamental importance in aviation, because all the materials
            used in an aircraft are subject to special certification procedures. If conventional
            materials are used in new designs, i.e., if materials are used that have already been
            qualified, a significantly simpler certification procedure results than would be the
            case if new materials are used that have not already been approved and certified.
            In this procedure not only known materials but also known production processes are
            important, because the latter, too, are taken into account in the certification procedures.
            In the multilayer board according to the invention, which multilayer board is intended
            for use in aircraft, it is thus advantageous to use known materials and known production
            processes in order to keep the certification procedures required for aviation as simple
            as possible, wherein in this context both time-related and financial aspects play
            an important role.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">It should be pointed out that in the context of the present invention the term “aircraft”
            refers in particular to airplanes and helicopters.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, it should be pointed out that in the context of the present invention
            the term “slit” is used to describe any elongated or essentially flat recess in a
            material. In order to form a slit, apart from the shape during the production of the
            core sheet, various processing methods can also be used, for example milling, drilling,
            etching, sawing, filing etc. The space, i.e., hollow space, arising in this process
            means that in this region no force transmission or only very modest force transmission
            can take place. Consequently, the hollow space either remains as a hollow space or
            can be filled with some other material, for example a foam material or some other
            material, with which material force transmission between the slit walls can take place
            only to a very reduced extent or is completely impossible. Furthermore, it should
            be pointed out that the depth of the slit extends in the direction of the core sheet
            thickness. In this arrangement the depth of the slit can extend either perpendicularly
            to the surface of the core sheet or at an angle to said core sheet.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">Depending on the applied processing method or production method of the slits, the
            slit can be straight in the direction of the depth of the slit, or it can comprise
            some other sectional shape, for example it can be undulating or angular.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">In longitudinal direction, i.e., in the direction of elongation parallel to the surface
            of the core sheet, the slit can extend in a linear manner or in the manner of a curve
            or in a linear manner for part of the way. In this arrangement several slits can be
            arranged so as to be parallel to each other or they can be arranged so as to be distributed
            across the panel plane in any desired arrangement.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, several slits can also be arranged so that they intersect, e.g. in the
            manner of a grid.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, it is also possible for the slits not to be continuous along their longitudinal
            direction, but instead to comprise slit sections that are not connected to each other,
            in the manner of a dashed line or a dashed-and-dotted line.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">Lengthwise the slits may reach right to the edge of the panel, because this makes
            it easier to form the slits.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">If a closed face of the panels is desired, e.g., for design reasons, the slits can
            also end short of the edge.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a further embodiment the slits extend across approximately 40 to 90% of the core
            sheet thickness.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this way on the one hand a core sheet is provided that comprises the necessary
            acoustic softness to reduce the emitted sound. On the other hand this also ensures
            that the core sheet comprises adequate strength beyond the slits so that a panel with
            adequate mechanical stability when exposed to loads is provided.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further embodiment the slits extend over approximately 70% of the core sheet
            thickness.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0022">Tests have shown that this ratio takes good account of the two different aspects of
            acoustic insulation and stability.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a still further embodiment the core sheet comprises a foam material.</p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a further embodiment the core sheet comprises a honeycomb structure in which a
            multitude of tubular or honeycomb-like cells extend in the direction of the core sheet
            thickness, wherein the cells are separated from each other by cell walls, and the
            slits are provided in the cell walls.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">The honeycomb structure may provide the best possible stability of the core sheet
            while at the same time being of a relatively lightweight nature so that the multilayer
            board overall is as light in weight as possible, i.e., the multilayer board can be
            used in a variety of applications.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">The use of honeycomb cores may be particularly suited to fields of application in
            which component weight is of importance. In this context the field of aviation should
            be mentioned first and foremost, where the topic of weight assumes particular importance.
            In the operation of an aircraft, for example an airplane, any reduction in weight
            provides economic and ecological advantages. As a result of fuel costs that have been
            rising lately, and as a result of the problematic nature of CO
            <sub>2 </sub>emission, which in the meantime is considered to be common sense, the aspect of component
            weight has been accorded increased importance.

         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a further embodiment the core sheet features a multilayer design comprising at
            least two core layers that by way of at least one intermediate layer are interconnected
            in a planar fashion, wherein at least one core layer on the side facing another core
            layer comprises slits that are open on one side.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">As a result of the above, forming slits in the core layers is as simple as possible.
            For example, core layers that are available as board-shaped semi-finished goods can
            be processed with ease with the use of a saw or a milling machine in that the slits
            are made from one side, so that on the opposite side of the board a continuous zone
            arises which when it is later joined to the covering layers provides the best-possible
            force transmission in the region of the covering layers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">As a result of the multilayer design it is, for example, also possible in a simple
            manner to form slits in a honeycomb structure, which slits can be made from one side,
            wherein a further core layer, for example in the form of a further honeycomb structure,
            is subsequently connected in a planar fashion to the first core layer in such a manner
            that as a result of this the slits of the first core layer, which slits are open on
            one side, are quasi covered so that the multilayer board on both sides in the direction
            of the covering layers in each case comprises a continuous edge zone that is required
            for force deviation when an external force acts on said board.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a further embodiment each of the core layers comprises a honeycomb structure in
            which a multitude of tube-like or honeycomb-like cells extend in the direction of
            the core sheet thickness, wherein the cells are separated from each other by cell
            walls, and slits in the cell walls are provided.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the core layers comprise an identical honeycomb structure, and the combs
            of the honeycomb cores are arranged so as to be aligned with each other.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an alternative further embodiment the honeycomb cores of the core layers are arranged
            so as to be offset relative to each other.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a still further exemplary embodiment the core layers comprise different honeycomb
            cores.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0035" num="0034">Consequently, as a result of the different honeycomb widths, depending on the cover
            layer materials used, it may be possible, for example, to provide surfaces of boards,
            which surfaces differ in strength.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a further embodiment for example three core layers are provided, of which the outer
            core layers have the same honeycomb width, while the middle core layer comprises a
            honeycomb width that differs from the aforesaid, for example a wider honeycomb width.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a further embodiment, two core layers on facing sides comprise slits that are open
            on one side.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this way it may be possible, for example, to produce in a simple way two core layers
            that are processed in the same manner in that the slits are made from one side, wherein
            subsequently the two core layers are arranged with these open sides facing each other
            so that a core sheet is provided that comprises the necessary continuous edge zones
            on both sides parallel to the covering layers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a further embodiment the core sheet comprises three core layers, wherein the middle
            core layer comprises continuously open slits.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0040" num="0039">Since the middle core layer comprises slits it is at first in principle not necessary
            for the two exterior core layers to also comprise slits; this can have advantages
            during the production process. By balancing the thicknesses of the exterior core layers
            relative to the thickness of the middle core layer, different slit proportions of
            the entire core sheet can be obtained, in other words multilayer boards with different
            acoustic insulation characteristics can be provided.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a further embodiment each of the two exterior core layers on the side facing the
            middle core layer comprises slits that are open on one side.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">This may result in further optimization options or adaptation options of the multilayer
            board as far as its acoustic insulation is concerned.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a further embodiment the slits in the middle core layer are not continuous over
            the entire layer thickness.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0044" num="0043">As a result of the above, the stability of the middle core layer may be improved to
            the extent that this core layer is easier to handle, because overall it is somewhat
            sturdier.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a further embodiment the slits are arranged so as to be offset relative to each
            other.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0046" num="0045">Offsetting the slits results on the one hand in the necessary softness of the core
            sheet, wherein, because of the offset slits, the two adjacent core layers are interconnected
            to a somewhat lesser extent.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a further embodiment variant the slits are arranged so as to be aligned with each
            other.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0048" num="0047">This makes it possible to achieve improved connection of the adjacent core layers.</p>
         <p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, the at least one intermediate layer comprises an adhesive layer by means
            of which the two adjacent core layers are connected.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, the aforesaid can be an adhesive layer applied as a film or foil, which
            in a further process step, for example involving heating, ensures the necessary adhesive
            effect, i.e., the connection between the two core layers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0051" num="0050">The adhesive layer can, for example, be an applied adhesive which connects the two
            adjacent core layers in a targeted manner by their mutual points of contact.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a further embodiment the connection of adjacent core layers in the region of the
            intermediate layer can also take place in that due to external effects the adjacent
            core layer materials are integrally interconnected, for example as a result of the
            application of pressure or heat.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a further embodiment variant the at least one intermediate layer is an attenuation
            tape that interconnects the core layers by its adhesive effect and that comprises
            a material that has a mechanically absorbent effect.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0054" num="0053">An attenuation tape provides an advantage in that it contributes to the acoustic effect
            by attenuating the amplitudes of the lateral waves.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a further embodiment variant the at least one intermediate layer is a prepreg.
            A prepreg may be suitable, for example, with the use of honeycomb cores which in the
            region of high-performance materials comprise, for example, fiber-reinforced plastic.
            If a prepreg is used, connection of the core layers can, for example, take place in
            a curing process in combination with connection to the two covering layers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0056" num="0055">The described multilayer boards are particularly suitable for use in aircraft construction
            in the context of the interior lining of cabins, in particular of passenger cabins.
            In this field, apart from their space-forming functions, panels also assume aesthetic
            or visual functions. However, an essential function of panels consists of their acoustic
            insulation and of their reduced sound emission. For example, the described multilayer
            boards are used as a lining in the shell region, i.e., between the cabin space and
            the exterior skin of an aircraft, or also as a space-partitioning element within the
            aircraft cabin, for example for separating different seating categories or for lining
            sanitary installations. A principal requirement to be met by a panel used in the region
            of the cabin partition walls and the cabin lining relates to the reduction in sound
            propagation in the cabin as a result of reflection. Apart from this, an essential
            task is to acoustically separate from the cabin the noise sources which when viewed
            from the cabin are located behind the lining, for example lines situated between the
            aircraft shell and the cabin panels, or the engines arranged on the wings.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0057" num="0056">A further embodiment provides for one of the two covering layers to be of an acoustically
            open design. In this way, for example if a honeycomb design is used in the core sheet,
            the regions of the core sheet, in other words the cells, can be used to produce a
            so-called Helmholtz resonator so that the multilayer board can be used not only for
            acoustic insulation, but also for absorption. Acoustic permeability can, for example,
            be achieved by perforation of the covering layer.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, the previously described multilayer boards can be arranged with their
            closed covering layer facing in the direction of the cabin, so that from the direction
            of the cabin space a closed and durable surface is provided. At the same time, due
            to the sound-absorbent effect there is also absorption of the sound that acts from
            the exterior on the lining element, i.e., on the multilayer board.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0059" num="0058">The object of the invention is, in particular, also met by an aircraft comprising
            a fuselage construction and a cabin formed within the fuselage, which cabin at least
            in some regions is enclosed by an interior lining formed by panels. According to the
            invention at least some of the panels comprise a multilayer board for acoustic insulation
            according to one of the preceding embodiments.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0060" num="0059">Because of the multilayer boards according to the invention, the aircraft according
            to the invention comprises improved acoustic insulation so that the quality of staying
            on board is enhanced for passengers. In this arrangement the multilayer boards according
            to the invention ensure on the one hand the already mentioned acoustic insulation,
            and on the other hand also adequate stability and sturdiness of the interior lining.
            This is of importance against the background of the interior lining being exposed
            to direct contact with passengers, wherein forces can be experienced which act on
            the cabin lining panel from the direction of the cabin interior. For example, it frequently
            happens that passengers use the lining to support themselves, for example when leaving
            the seat. Often it also happens that passengers seated beside a wall lean against
            the interior lining when they are tired. Apart from this those loads should also be
            mentioned which as a rule act temporarily and in a small area in the form of impact
            loads, for example when an item of baggage bumps against the wall lining or if a passenger
            falls against the wall lining, and, last but not least, in the case of decompression,
            for example if a leak in the aircraft fuselage arises. Thus, the interior lining is
            subjected to various loads that it must withstand, or whose forces it must transfer
            to structural components. As a result of the design of the multilayer boards that
            are used for the interior lining, in which boards the acoustically required slits
            are only arranged in a region that is to a small extent or not at all used for transmitting
            tension and compression forces, a stable interior lining of the aircraft is provided.
            The improvement in the acoustic insulation without negatively affecting the stability
            does, of course, also take into account the aspect of component weight, because improvement
            of the acoustics is achieved without any increase in component weight; on the contrary,
            as a result of the slits provided, there is an albeit small reduction in the component
            weight when compared to the weight of a multilayer board without improved acoustic
            insulation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the invention, a method for producing a multilayer board for acoustic
            insulation is also provided.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an exemplary embodiment of the method, the following steps are provided: first
            a core sheet is provided by making slits in at least one first core layer, wherein
            the slits extend from one side in the direction of the core layer thickness in such
            a manner that the at least one first core layer comprises a continuous edge zone that
            extends parallel to the area of the core layer, and by arranging an intermediate layer
            on the side of the core layer with the open slits, and by applying a second core layer
            to the intermediate layer. Subsequently, the core sheet is arranged between a first
            covering layer and a second covering layer, wherein at least one of the two covering
            layers is of a closed design. Thereafter the core sheet is connected to the covering
            layers, wherein the core sheet is firmly connected in a planar fashion to the covering
            layers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0063" num="0062">The slits within the core sheet result in reduced shear stiffness of the board which
            results in reduced sound emission, in other words results in improved acoustic insulation.
            The continuous edge zones on both sides of the core sheet ensure the best-possible
            force transmission in these regions by interaction with the exterior covering layers.
            By the edge zones a bond effect can be achieved which corresponds to that of non-slit
            boards. In other words, despite improved acoustic insulation, the board can withstand
            similar tension compression forces, or respectively tension and compression forces
            that are just as severe.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a further embodiment a method is provided in which, prior to applying the second
            core sheet, slits are made to the second core sheet, which slits extend from one side
            in the direction of the core layer thickness in such a manner that the second core
            layer comprises a continuous edge zone that extends parallel to the core layer area.
            Thereafter, with its side comprising the open slits the second core layer is placed
            onto the intermediate layer, wherein the slits are arranged so as to be aligned.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this manner the slits can be produced in the simplest possible manner, and the
            multilayer board can be produced economically.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, a honeycomb material is used as the core sheet, which honeycomb material
            as a result of its light weight, while at the same time providing good mechanical
            loadability, is particularly suitable for interior construction in the field of aviation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a further embodiment of the method for production the required materials are purchased
            already as a semi-finished product. The honeycombs are made by a supplier and are
            slit already at the supplier. In the variants in which the slits are not made over
            the full height, the honeycombs are held together in a planar fashion so that they
            can be handled in the same manner as honeycomb boards without slits. In addition,
            in order to form the intermediate layer, prepregs comprising a woven glass material
            or some other fibers are supplied, which prepregs are already impregnated with resin
            that has not yet cured. The layers supplied in this manner are placed one on top of
            the other as required. Since the prepreg is so to speak still sticky, all layers can
            be connected with adequate initial adhesion. Thereafter the entire structure is slid
            into the autoclave where it is cured at high temperatures. Cutting to size can take
            place either before or after placement one on top of the other, or after curing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0068" num="0067">The invention preferably also relates to the use of a multilayer board according to
            any one of the above-mentioned embodiments in an aircraft, in particular in an airplane.

            <b>10</b> comprising an airplane fuselage 
            <b>12</b> as well as two wings 
            <b>14</b> that laterally follow on from said airplane fuselage 
            <b>12</b>, to which wings 
            <b>14</b> engines 
            <b>15</b> have been affixed, with only one engine 
            <b>15</b> being shown. figref[FIG. 1]
            	 shows a section view of the airplane fuselage 
            <b>12</b> across its longitudinal axis. As shown in the illustration, the airplane fuselage
            
            <b>12</b> comprises an upper cabin region 
            <b>16</b> and a freight region 
            <b>18</b> arranged underneath the aforesaid, with the two regions 
            <b>16</b> and 
            <b>18</b> being separated from each other by a horizontally extending floor 
            <b>20</b>. The airplane fuselage 
            <b>12</b> comprises an essentially circumferential exterior skin 
            <b>22</b> of the airplane, which exterior skin 
            <b>22</b> is attached to an airplane fuselage structure (for the sake of clarity not shown).
            The airplane fuselage structure usually comprises a type of load-bearing structure
            comprising frame elements and stringers, and ensures a sturdy structure into which
            exterior and interior loads can be transmitted.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0079" num="0078">The cabin region 
            <b>16</b>, which is arranged above the floor 
            <b>20</b>, along the exterior skin 
            <b>22</b> comprises lateral cabin linings 
            <b>24</b>, 
            <b>26</b> and an upper cabin lining 
            <b>28</b> in the upper region. As shown in the illustration, the elements of the cabin lining
            
            <b>24</b>, 
            <b>26</b>, and 
            <b>28</b> together with the floor 
            <b>20</b> form an interior space, i.e., the cabin region 
            <b>16</b>. For use of the cabin, it is possible, for example, for seats 
            <b>30</b> for passengers to be arranged therein. Furthermore, hatracks 
            <b>32</b> are provided above the seat rows, which hatracks 
            <b>32</b> are used to receive the carry-on baggage of passengers. Furthermore, in the cabin
            region 
            <b>16</b> various supply lines can also be provided, for example an oxygen supply, an electrical
            supply or ventilation equipment, which for the sake of clarity is not shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0080" num="0079">The exterior loads, for example wind loads and loads resulting from pressure differentials,
            which loads act on the fuselage region, are transmitted from the exterior skin 
            <b>22</b> to the supporting structure of the airplane fuselage and are thus deflected. For
            use of the cabin as a passenger cabin it is necessary to provide a cabin with suitable
            conditions. To this effect the exterior wall construction as a rule also comprises
            a thermal insulation that is attached to said exterior skin inside the exterior skin.
            Furthermore, the exterior wall construction is preferably designed to provide acoustic
            insulation, for example to reduce noise input from the engines 
            <b>15</b> to the cabin region 
            <b>16</b> to a minimum.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0081" num="0080">The cabin lining 
            <b>24</b>, 
            <b>26</b>, 
            <b>28</b> serve to assume both a space-terminating function and to improve the acoustic conditions
            within the cabin region 
            <b>16</b>. To this effect the cabin linings 
            <b>24</b>,
            <b>26</b>, and 
            <b>28</b> can, for example, be designed so as to provide acoustic insulation and acoustic absorption.

            form of a multilayer board 
            <b>40</b>. The multilayer board 
            <b>40</b> comprises a core sheet 
            <b>42</b>, a first covering layer 
            <b>44</b> and a second covering layer 
            <b>46</b>. The two covering layers

            <b>46</b> are of a closed design, i. e. they are designed so as to be as far as possible acoustically
            closed. However, it should be pointed out that according to the invention it would
            also be adequate if only one of the two covering layers were acoustically closed.

            <b>44</b>, 
            <b>46</b>. According to the invention, the core sheet

            <b>48</b> which extend within the core sheet 
            <b>42</b> in the direction of the core sheet thickness, while the core sheet

            <b>56</b>, which layers 
            <b>54</b> and

            <b>54</b>, 
            <b>56</b>, the intermediate layer

            <b>54</b>, 
            <b>56</b> in an adhesive manner and that comprises a material that has a mechanically absorbent
            effect.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0088" num="0087">As a result of the slits 
            <b>48</b> in the core sheet 
            <b>42</b>, the shear stiffness of the multilayer board 
            <b>40</b> is reduced, which results in a reduction in the velocity of the flexural wave. In
            this arrangement the slits 
            <b>48</b> are to be formed in such a manner that removal of material occurs so that force transmission
            between the slit walls is impossible. With the use of an attenuation tape an additional
            improvement in acoustic insulation is achieved. At the same time, the design of continuous
            edge zones provides an optimum force region in the transition region between the core
            sheet and the covering layers, i.e., a region which in terms of stress is subjected
            to the greatest loads. Since the acoustically effective slits are arranged in the
            region of the middle of the board, i. e. in the region of the neutral phase during
            loading across the board area, there is either no influence or only very reduced influence
            of the mechanical stability in terms of the loads acting on the area. This will be
            demonstrated with reference to test results shown in figref[FIG. 6]

            in such a manner that the at least one first core layer comprises a continuous edge
            zone that extends parallel to the core layer surface. Thereafter an intermediate layer
            is arranged 
            <b>94</b> on the side of the first core layer with the open slits. Subsequently, a second core
            layer is placed 
            <b>95</b> on the intermediate layer. In the case of more than two core layers, correspondingly,
            further steps take place; i.e., arranging a further intermediate layer and placing
            a further core layer. Thereafter, the core layer is arranged 
            <b>96</b> between a first covering layer and a second covering layer, wherein at least one

            yet cured. The layers supplied in this manner are placed one on top of the other as
            required. Since the prepreg is so to speak still sticky, all the layers can be connected
            with adequate initial adhesion. Thereafter the entire structure is slid into the autoclave
            where it is cured at high temperatures. Cutting to size can take place either before
            or after placement one on top of the other, or after curing.
