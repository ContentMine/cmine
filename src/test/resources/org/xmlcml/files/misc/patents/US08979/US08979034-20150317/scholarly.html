      <p>A device for non-cooperatively capturing an object is provided. The device includes
         a boom having a fixed end coupled to a structure and a free end. The boom also includes
         boom deployers for moving the fixed end of the boom relative to the structure. The
         device also includes a capture head, coupled to the free end of the boom, and a control
         apparatus. The control apparatus controls the boom deployers and capture head to move
         the capture head in close proximity to the object. The control apparatus moves the
         capture head in closer proximity to the object if the capture head is not close enough
         to the object to capture the object. The control apparatus minimizes forces applied
         to the object, and activates a non-cooperative capture device. The non-cooperative
         capture device makes initial contact with the object, establishes intimate contact
         with the object, and captures the object.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Robotic arms have been in existence for several decades. Many industries utilize robotic
            arms to speed production, improve product assembly quality, and manipulate hazardous
            objects and materials. Most robotic arms in the world are designed for heavy, repetitive
            manufacturing work, and handle tasks that are difficult, dangerous, or boring to human
            beings.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical robotic arm is controlled by a computer by activating individual step motors
            or actuators connected at each joint. At a minimum, a robotic arm has a single segment
            and a joint at each end. Larger robotic arms often use hydraulics or pneumatics to
            control arm motion. Robotic arms often use motion sensors to regulate movement in
            precise increments.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">A robotic arm, called the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) or Canadarm, was
            used on the Space Shuttle to maneuver a payload from the payload bay of the orbiter
            to a deployment position and then release the payload. The SRMS is also able to grapple
            certain payloads, maneuver it to the payload bay of the orbiter, and berth it. SRMS
            was first used on the second Space Shuttle mission launched Nov. 13, 1981. The SRMS
            robotic arm is 15.2 meters (50 feet, 3 inches) long and 38 centimeters (15 inches)
            in diameter, and has six degrees of freedom. It weighs 410 kilograms (905 pounds).
            Although the original SRMS was capable of deploying or retrieving payloads weighing
            up to 32.5 tons, the system was later upgraded to increase payload capacity up to
            293 tons in order to support space station assembly operations.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">A later robotic arm, the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) or Canadarm2, is used on the
            International Space Station (ISS). Launched to the ISS in 2001, it plays a key role
            in station assembly and maintenance. The MSS moves equipment and supplies around the
            station, supports astronauts working in space, and services instruments and payloads
            attached to the ISS. The MSS is self-relocatable, and can move end-over-end to reach
            many parts of the ISS. The ISS is planned to also utilize other robotic arms such
            as the Japanese Experimental Module Remote Manipulator System (JEM-RMS) and the European
            Robotic Arm (ERA).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current technology robotic arms utilize capture heads incorporating mechanical grippers,
            where mechanical force between two or more surfaces are used to positively capture
            and move objects. Mechanical grippers are suitable to capture known objects of predictable
            size, shape, and orientation and having robust attachment surfaces.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to solving disadvantages of the prior art. In accordance
            with embodiments of the present invention, a device for non-cooperatively capturing
            an object is provided. The device includes a boom, where the boom includes a fixed
            end coupled to a structure, and a free end. The free end is able to move relative
            to the structure. The boom also includes one or more boom deployers for moving the
            fixed end of the boom relative to the structure. The device for non-cooperatively
            capturing an object also includes a capture head, coupled to the free end of the boom,
            and a control apparatus. The capture head includes a non-cooperative capture device.
            The control apparatus controls the one or more boom deployers and the capture head
            to move the capture head in proximity to the object. The control apparatus determines
            if the capture head is close enough to the object to capture the object, and moves
            the capture head in closer proximity to the object if the capture apparatus determines
            the capture head is not close enough to the object to capture the object. The control
            apparatus minimizes relative velocity between the capture head and the object, and
            activates a non-cooperative capture device in the capture head after the non-cooperative
            capture device makes initial contact with the object. The non-cooperative capture
            device establishes intimate contact between the capture head and the object, and the
            capture head arrests the object motion.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a method for non-cooperatively
            capturing an object is provided. The method includes utilizing a control apparatus
            to move a capture apparatus into close proximity to the object. The capture apparatus
            includes a boom, where the boom includes a fixed end attached to a structure, and
            a free end. The free end is able to move relative to the structure. The capture apparatus
            also includes a boom deployer for moving the free end of the boom; and a capture head,
            coupled to the free end of the boom. The capture head includes a non-cooperative capture
            device. The method also includes determining if the capture head is close enough to
            the object to capture the object. If the capture head is not close enough to the object
            to capture the object, the control apparatus moves the capture head closer to the
            object. If the capture head is close enough to the object to capture the object, the
            method provides minimizing relative velocity, by the control apparatus, between the
            capture head and the object, preparing the capture head to make contact with the object,
            making initial contact between the non-cooperative capture device and the object,
            activating the non-cooperative capture device, making initial contact between the
            non-cooperative capture device and the object, establishing intimate contact between
            the capture head and the object, and arresting the object motion. The control apparatus
            is able to move the object after the object motion has been arrested.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for
            non-cooperatively capturing an object in space is provided. The apparatus includes
            a boom. The boom includes a fixed end coupled to a structure, and a free end. The
            structure is a satellite, a space station, a space suited astronaut, or a spacecraft.
            The free end is able to move relative to the structure. The boom is expandable and
            retractable between the fixed and free end. The apparatus also includes a capture
            head, coupled to the free end of the boom, and a control apparatus for controlling
            movement of the capture head relative to the structure and engagement between the
            capture head and the object. The capture head also includes a non-cooperative capture
            device. The non-cooperative capture device includes one or more capture device pads
            utilizing a resettable adhesive to establish intimate contact between the capture
            head and the object. The control apparatus directs movement of the boom and capture
            head to move the capture head in proximity to the object, and determines if the capture
            head is close enough to the object to capture the object. The control apparatus moves
            the capture head in closer proximity to the object if the control apparatus determines
            the capture head is not close enough to the object to capture the object. The control
            apparatus minimizes relative velocity between the capture head and the object, and
            includes one or more articulated support members including one or more capture head
            actuators that control the position and orientation of the one or more articulated
            support members. The one or more articulated support members determine the position
            and orientation of the one or more non-cooperative capture device pads, and one or
            more sensors of the control apparatus determine the shape, topography, and/or texture
            of the object. In response, the control apparatus directs the capture head actuators
            to conform to the shape, topography, and/or texture of the object prior to the non-cooperative
            capture device making initial contact with the object. The non-cooperative capture
            device makes initial contact with the object, and activates a non-cooperative capture
            device in the capture head. The non-cooperative capture device establishes intimate
            contact between the capture head and the object, and the control apparatus arrests
            object motion. Finally, the control apparatus directs movement of the boom and capture
            head to move the object in space.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">An advantage of the present invention is that it provides a method for capturing and
            controlling an unpredictably sized and shaped object. The object is not required to
            have any standard attachment points. This allows the present invention to be used
            for recovering objects smaller than or larger than the capture head size. Also, objects
            having rough, smooth, or complex shapes may be recovered, including non man-made objects
            including space debris or asteroids.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another advantage of the present invention is it provides the ability to recover
            objects faster than with mechanical grippers. The present invention does not depend
            on the same degree of fine control as many types of mechanical grippers. All that
            is required is positioning a non-cooperative capture device in close enough proximity
            to an object being recovered such that activating the non-cooperative capture device
            will bring the non-cooperative capture device into contact with the object. Depending
            on the degree of fine control associated with a mechanical gripper, it may take many
            attempts to recover an object, and each attempt may take a long period of time if
            fine control motions are performed at a relatively slow speed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">A further advantage of the present invention is minimizing damage to sensitive outer
            coverings or electronics on recoverable payloads. Many existing spacecraft, satellites,
            and space stations are covered in Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI). MLI is relatively
            fragile, and easily damaged by mechanical grippers. The present invention utilizes
            low force per unit area in the capture process, reducing the likelihood of damaging
            fragile MLI or sensitive electronics.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additional features and advantages of embodiments of the present invention will become
            more readily apparent from the following description, particularly when taken together
            with the accompanying drawings.

      <div>
         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0036" num="0035">Robotic arms have been used for many tasks involving capture and moving objects. Typically,
            robotic arms are terminated in mechanical hands or grippers designed to emulate grasping
            motions associated with human hands or mechanical tools—such as pliers or certain
            types of wrenches. Mechanical grippers are suitable for capturing many types of payloads,
            where the payload is within the mechanical specifications of the mechanical grippers,
            and able to not be damaged by the mechanical grippers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0037" num="0036">One such specification for a mechanical gripper is the amount by which the gripper
            may fully open. Related to this are angular relationships between each of the gripper
            elements, or fingers. These specifications will largely determine the maximum size
            of the payload which may be captured, or the size and orientation of an attachment
            point on the payload that the gripper may capture.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another such specification is the number and flexibility of gripping services provided
            by the mechanical gripper. For example, simple grippers may have a fixed finger in
            conjunction with an actuated finger, where the actuated finger is able to open and
            close relative to the fixed finger. And other gripper may have two actuated fingers
            that oppose each other, where each of the actuated fingers is able to open and close
            relative to the other finger. More complex grippers may have three or more actuated
            fingers that oppose each other. Furthermore, each finger may have multiple articulation
            points such as joints or knuckles as present in human fingers. Although more complex
            grippers may be capable of capture a greater variety of payloads and/or attachment
            points, the additional complexity comes at the expense of higher cost, weight, training,
            and lower reliability due to higher mechanical and control software complexity.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0039" num="0038">Yet another such specification for a mechanical gripper is the type of gripping surface
            provided on the fingers of the gripper. For example, a ridged surface such as provided
            on the jaws of pliers may provide a more secure purchase on payloads and/or attachment
            points, but at the expense of potentially damaging more fragile payloads. As another
            example, a rough surface such used by course sandpaper or a smooth surface may be
            provided. Depending on the payload, a more course surface or a smooth surface may
            be preferred.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0040" num="0039">Finally, a mechanical gripper is ultimately controlled by a control system utilizing
            autonomous or human control. Depending on the design of the mechanical gripper control
            system, fine control of gripper position and gripper manipulation may be difficult
            if not impossible. This may result in very lengthy payload recovery operations, perhaps
            increasing cost and likelihood of damage to the payload.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to figref[FIG. 1]
            	
            <i>a</i>, a diagram illustrating a single segment sticky boom in accordance with embodiments
            of the present invention is shown. The sticky boom is generally configured as a boom
            
            <b>104</b>, with a boom fixed end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>a </i>attached to a fixed surface 
            <b>100</b>, or structure, and an opposite boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b </i>free to move. An object 
            <b>124</b> is captured and recovered by the sticky boom. In one embodiment, the sticky boom
            moves the object 
            <b>124</b> in a predetermined direction. In another embodiment, the sticky boom attaches a structure
            to the object 
            <b>124</b> so that other booms 
            <b>104</b>, machines, or human operators may grab or move the object 
            <b>124</b> at a later time.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sticky boom has a fixed end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>a </i>and a free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b</i>. The boom fixed end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>a </i>is coupled to a fixed surface 
            <b>100</b>. The fixed surface 
            <b>100</b> provides a relative reference point for the boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b</i>. In one embodiment, the fixed surface 
            <b>100</b> is an exterior surface of a spacecraft or satellite. In another embodiment, the fixed
            surface 
            <b>100</b> is an exterior surface of a terrestrial or space vehicle, or a space station. In
            yet another embodiment, the fixed surface 
            <b>100</b> is a surface of a spacesuit or apparatus coupled to a spacesuit and controlled by
            an astronaut or human operator in the spacesuit. It should be noted that embodiments
            of the sticky boom are suitable for use in either terrestrial or space applications.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0043" num="0042">The sticky boom includes one or more boom deployers 
            <b>108</b>. The boom deployer 
            <b>108</b> includes one or more boom actuators 
            <b>144</b> that move the boom 
            <b>104</b> in some fashion. In one embodiment, the boom deployer 
            <b>108</b> controls boom actuators 
            <b>144</b> at the boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b</i>. In another embodiment, the boom deployer 
            <b>108</b> controls boom actuators 
            <b>144</b> at the boom fixed end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>a</i>. In yet another embodiment, the boom deployer 
            <b>108</b> controls boom actuators 
            <b>144</b> at both the boom fixed end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>a </i>and the boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b</i>. The boom deployer 
            <b>108</b> may optionally include one or more sensors 
            <b>132</b> to provide feedback on boom 
            <b>104</b> position, object 
            <b>124</b> position, boom 
            <b>104</b> forces, or boom actuator 
            <b>144</b> state within boom deployer 
            <b>108</b>. Sensors 
            <b>132</b> may also be capable of performing detailed surface mapping of the object 
            <b>124</b>, in order to increase the likelihood of successful object 
            <b>124</b> capture by the sticky boom.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0044" num="0043">The sticky boom also includes a capture head 
            <b>116</b>. The capture head 
            <b>116</b> is coupled to the boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b</i>, and provides the support structures and capture apparatuses for capturing the object
            
            <b>124</b>. The coupling between the capture head 
            <b>116</b> and boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b </i>may be a fixed coupling that maintains consistent orientation between the capture
            head 
            <b>116</b> in the boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b</i>. The coupling may also be an articulated coupling providing some degree of motion
            between capture head 
            <b>116</b> and boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b</i>. Articulated couplings include rotational couplings, hinges, swivels, gimbals, and
            any other type of mechanical coupling capable of providing predictable movement of
            the capture head 
            <b>116</b> relative to the boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b</i>. Articulated couplings may also use one or more springs to passively control movement
            between the capture head 
            <b>116</b> and the boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b</i>. In some embodiments, the articulated couplings include electromechanical devices
            such as step motors, solenoids, or servos to control capture head 
            <b>116</b> movement remotely.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the coupling between the capture head 
            <b>116</b> and boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
            <i>b </i>provides temporary or permanent separation between the capture head 
            <b>116</b> and the boom free end 
            <b>112</b>
