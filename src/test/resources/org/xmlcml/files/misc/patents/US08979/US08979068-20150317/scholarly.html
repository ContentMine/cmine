      <p>A differential pressure sealing device for use with ball valves that utilizes the
         pressure of the fluid being communicated in a piping system to increase the sealing
         force created by the sealing device. Fluid being communicated through a ball valve
         is provided to a sealing device that includes some type of element for creating a
         bias force. The pressure of the fluid being communicated increases the sealing pressure
         created by the sealing device. In this manner, the bias force created in the sealing
         device benefits from the pressure of the fluid being communicated to enhance the sealing
         when used with a ball valve or similar component.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to a sealing device for use with ball valves.
            More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a differential pressure sealing
            device that utilizes the pressure created by the fluid passing through a piping system
            including a ball valve to pressurize a seating mechanism to aid in the operation of
            the ball valve.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Dirty, scaling fluids are fouling-up valves of all types in many industrial applications,
            including the refining, oil and gas production, geothermal power, chemical, pipeline
            and mining industries. The main weakness in most valves and in ball valves in particular,
            is that their seating designs do not keep particles and scale deposits out of the
            valve seat ring crevices, grooves, and cavities. This is particularly the case in
            trunnion style ball valves since their seat rings must be able to move axially to
            allow the line pressure to urge the seat onto the ball. When the seat ring cannot
            travel back and forth within the body end flange seat ring pocket, the seat cannot
            properly engage the ball seating surface and the valve cannot shut off, and/or the
            operating torques become excessive to the point of preventing the operation of the
            valve with resultant damage to the valve seats and its ball surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Trunnion ball valves, in particular, cannot be reliably used in many services such
            as with liquids and vapors that cause scale build-ups, and fluids that contain entrained
            minerals and solid materials such as sand, because such materials pack into the seat
            ring pocket spaces behind the seat rings of the valve and lock-it-up.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure generally relates to a sealing device for use with ball valves
            that utilizes the pressure created by the fluid passing through the ball valve to
            pressurize a sealing ring of a seating mechanism to aid in the operation of the ball
            valve.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">The sealing system of the present disclosure is particularly desirable for use with
            trunnion ball valves and provides for excellent shutoff and ease of operation while
            at the same time eliminating the operational problems caused by sand, scale and debris.
            The sealing system of the present disclosure includes a two part metal seat ring cartridge
            that includes a chamber for energizing an axially-dynamic seat ring made by various
            materials, such as RTFE, peak, metals and ceramics, with a clean pressurizing fluid
            that is kept at a higher pressure than the pressure that the valve must seal against
            in the main pipe. Because the pressure behind the dynamic seat ring is higher than
            in the pipeline, the seating mechanism prevents the ingress of fluid from the main
            pipe into the seat ring energizing chamber, thus insuring the free axial movement
            of the seat ring against the sealing ball of the ball valve.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment of the disclosure, the seating member charging chamber can be pressurized
            by utilizing a spring loaded differential piston device that communicates the pressure
            in the main pipe to a clean fluid, such as a non-compressible valve sealant. The additional
            differential force to pressurize the clean sealant insures that the sealing system
            will always exert a higher pressure on the inside of the seat ring than the pressure
            of fluid in the pipe which is against the face of the seat ring. The pressure differential
            across the seat ring provides the force advantage that seals off the valve. The pressure
            differential also functions to keep any of the fluid the valve is handling from carrying
            sand, scale or debris into the charging chamber.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an alternate configuration, sealant is injected directly into the seating member
            charging chamber from a small sealant reservoir. The system maintains the sealant
            at a selected, constant pressure that is sufficiently higher than the pressure in
            the pipe to provide the force to seal off the valve and to prevent the ingress of
            any of the process fluid the valve is handling.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another alternate configuration, the fluid coming from the pipe is filtered
            and used as the fluid to pressurize the seating member charging chamber. The charging
            chamber includes an additional spring to generate the pressure differential across
            the seat ring that is needed to provide shutoff and prevent the ingress of any fluid
            or contaminate into the chamber from the processed fluid the valve is handling.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another alternate embodiment, the system utilizes a compatible fluid other
            than a sealant or the media the valve is handling to pressurize the seat ring. As
            an example, air, nitrogen, water or steam can be used to charge the seating member
            charging chamber and power the seat ring. In the case of steam, it will be possible
            to more efficiently heat a valve seat ring for use in viscous services.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring first to figref[FIG. 1]
            	, thereshown is a differential pressure sealing device 
            <b>10</b> mounted in an operative position to a ball valve assembly 
            <b>12</b>. The ball valve assembly 
            <b>12</b> includes an outer housing 
            <b>14</b> that encloses a rotating ball 
            <b>16</b> that is connected to a rotatable stem 
            <b>18</b>. The ball 
            <b>16</b> includes an open flow passageway 
            <b>20</b> that allows a fluid, which may be a liquid or gas, to selectively pass through the
            ball valve as the ball 
            <b>16</b> is rotated in the housing 
            <b>14</b>. The ball 
            <b>16</b> includes multiple seating surfaces 
            <b>22</b>. The ball 
            <b>16</b> is rotatable within the outer housing 
            <b>14</b> to selectively restrict fluid flow through a piping system 
            <b>24</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">The differential pressure sealing device 
            <b>10</b> includes a sliding seating mechanism 
            <b>26</b> that is mounted within an internal cavity or groove 
            <b>28</b> formed in a metallic main body 
            <b>30</b>. The main body 
            <b>30</b> includes an end flange 
            <b>32</b> and an inner flange 
            <b>34</b>. The outer flange 
            <b>32</b> includes multiple attachment holes 
            <b>33</b> that allow the sealing device to be connected to a pipe of a piping system. The inner
            flange 
            <b>34</b> allows the pressure sealing device 
            <b>10</b> to be securely attached to the outer housing 
            <b>14</b> of the ball valve 
            <b>12</b> through a series of connectors 
            <b>36</b> and attachment nuts 
            <b>38</b>. Thus, as can be seen in figref[FIG. 1]
            	, the entire pressure sealing device 
            <b>10</b> can be attached to a ball valve 
            <b>12</b> to improve the sealing ability of the piping system
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">figref[FIG. 2]
            	 illustrates the installation of the pressure sealing device 
            <b>10</b> within a piping system 
            <b>24</b>. As described previously, the pressure sealing device 
            <b>10</b> includes the sliding seating mechanism 
            <b>26</b> that creates a seal with a seating surface 
            <b>22</b> formed on the ball 
            <b>16</b> of a conventional ball valve. The pressure sealing device 
            <b>10</b> forms part of a first embodiment of a sealing system 
            <b>40</b> shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	. The sealing system 
            <b>40</b> includes a pressurizing system 
            <b>42</b> that supplies a pressurized fluid, such as a non-compressible valve sealant, to power
            the sliding seating mechanism 
            <b>26</b>. In the embodiment shown in figref[FIG. 2]
            	, the pressurizing system 
            <b>42</b> includes an inlet port 
            <b>44</b> and an outlet port 
            <b>46</b>. The inlet port 
            <b>44</b> is in pressure communication with a pressure sensing port 
            <b>48</b> extending through an outer wall 
            <b>49</b> of the piping system 
            <b>24</b>. The pressure sensing port 
            <b>48</b> allows the inlet port 
            <b>44</b> to draw a portion of the fluid flowing through the open interior 
            <b>50</b> of the piping system 
            <b>24</b> into the inlet port 
            <b>44</b> through the inlet line 
            <b>64</b>. The fluid flowing in the piping system 
            <b>24</b> is flowing at a first pressure. The fluid drawn from the piping system 
            <b>24</b> and contained within the inlet port 
            <b>44</b> contacts a movable pressure wall 
            <b>52</b> that is in direct contact with a compressed charging spring 
            <b>54</b>. The charging spring 
            <b>54</b> is pre-compressed by stationary pegs 
            <b>51</b>. The opposite end of the charging spring 
            <b>54</b> contacts a moving piston 
            <b>56</b> that has an opposite end in fluid communication with a supply a pressurizing fluid,
            such as a non-compressible sealant, shown in the reservoir 
            <b>58</b>. The charging spring 
            <b>54</b> exerts a bias force on the piston 
            <b>56</b> to preload and pre-pressurize the volume of the pressurizing fluid contained within
            the reservoir 
            <b>58</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the pressurizing fluid contained within the reservoir
            
            <b>58</b> is a grease-based valve sealant but could be any other type of fluid, either gas
            or liquid, that can communicate a pressure from one area to another. A pressure outlet
            line 
            <b>60</b> leads from the outlet port 
            <b>46</b> to an inlet port 
            <b>62</b> formed in the inner flange 
            <b>34</b> of the pressure sealing device 
            <b>10</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0022">As illustrated in figref[FIG. 2]
            	, the pressure of the fluid within the outlet line 
            <b>60</b> is created by a combination of the pressure of the fluid in the inlet line 
            <b>62</b>, which corresponds to the pressure of the fluid within the open interior 
            <b>50</b>, and the bias force created by the charging spring 
            <b>54</b>. In this manner, the pressurizing system 
            <b>42</b> of the present disclosure insures that the pressure of the fluid contained within
            the pressurized outlet line 
            <b>60</b> is greater than the pressure of the fluid in the open interior 
            <b>50</b> of the piping system 
            <b>24</b> and thus in the inlet line 
            <b>64</b>. In the embodiment shown in figref[FIG. 2]
            	, a valve 
            <b>66</b> is positioned to allow air to be bled off from the reservoir 
            <b>58</b>. Further, the valve 
            <b>66</b> also functions as a fill valve that allows the fluid contained within the reservoir
            
            <b>58</b> to be filled and replenished as needed.

         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">figref[FIG. 3]
            	 illustrates a second embodiment of the pressurizing system 
            <b>42</b> that is utilized to create the required fluid pressure within the pressurized outlet
            line 
            <b>60</b>. In the embodiment shown in figref[FIG. 3]
            	, the pressurizing device includes a jack pump 
            <b>68</b> that includes a handle 
            <b>70</b>. The handle 
            <b>70</b> can be manually moved to create pressure on the hydraulic fluid or sealant contained
            within the open reservoir 
            <b>72</b>. The jack pump 
            <b>68</b> includes a pressure gauge 
            <b>74</b> that allows an operator to determine the amount of pressure created within the open
            reservoir 
            <b>72</b>. The alternate embodiment of the pressurizing system shown in figref[FIG. 3]
            	 creates the desired amount of fluid pressure within the pressurized outlet line 
            <b>60</b>, which in turn leads to the inlet port 
            <b>62</b> formed as part of the pressure sealing device 
            <b>10</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pressurizing system 
            <b>42</b> shown in figref[FIG. 3]
            	 can be modified to include a pulsation damper in the outlet line 
            <b>60</b> between the jack pump and the inlet port 
            <b>62</b>. Pulsation dampers are well-known components that include a bladder that is pre-charged
            by a supply of gas, such as nitrogen. The pulsation damper can be installed at the
            discharge side of the jack pump to reduce noise and vibration and create a more constant
            pressure on the sealing ring.

            	 illustrates yet another alternate embodiment of the pressurizing system 
            <b>42</b>. In the embodiment shown in figref[FIG. 4]
            	, the pressurizing system 
            <b>42</b> includes an inlet line 
            <b>64</b> that receives the fluid flowing within the open interior 
            <b>50</b> of the piping system 
            <b>24</b>. The fluid flows through the pressure sensing port 
            <b>48</b> and into a combination filter and dryer 
            <b>76</b>. The filter and dryer cleans and dries the fluid flowing through the piping system
            
            <b>24</b> such that after being filtered, the fluid from within the piping system flows into
            a pressurized outlet line 
            <b>60</b>. Since the pressurizing system 
            <b>42</b> draws a portion of the fluid from the open interior 
            <b>50</b> and uses the pressure of this fluid to drive the sliding seating mechanism 
            <b>26</b>, the sliding seating mechanism 
            <b>26</b> is designed to include a wave spring or coil spring to increase the pressure acting
            on the sliding seating mechanism 
            <b>26</b> above the pressure of the fluid within the piping system 
            <b>24</b>. Details of the use of a wave spring or coil spring to increase the pressure on the
            seat ring will be described in greater detail below with reference to figref[FIG. 6]

            <b>26</b> constructed in accordance with the disclosure. The sliding seating mechanism 
            <b>26</b> is formed as part of the pressure seating device 
            <b>10</b> and creates a seal against the seating surface 
            <b>22</b> of the ball 
            <b>16</b>. As described previously, the inner flange 
            <b>34</b> includes an inlet port 
            <b>62</b> that leads into a fluid passageway 
            <b>78</b>. The fluid passageway 
            <b>78</b> extends through the solid body 
            <b>30</b> of the inner flange 
            <b>34</b> and extends into fluid communication with an annular seating member charging chamber
