Specifically, the present invention relates to a clamp for attaching a pipe harness in which electric wires are inserted into a metal pipe to a vehicle body, in which an outer diameter tolerance of the metal pipe is absorbed and vibrations of the metal pipe and occurrence of abnormal noises are prevented.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In hybrid cars and electric cars, there are cases where electric wires connecting a battery and an inverter, or an inverter and a motor are inserted into a metal pipe to be wired. In JP 2006-312409A (Patent Document 1), pipe harness <b>100</b> is obtained by inserting electric wires <b>101</b> for connecting a battery and an inverter into a metal pipe <b>102</b>, and the pipe harness <b>100</b> is attached to a vehicle body <b>104</b> (undersurface of a floor panel) through a bracket <b>103</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The bracket <b>103</b> has an arm portion <b>103</b><i>b </i>protruding from a cylindrical portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>for being externally fitted to the metal pipe <b>102</b>, and a plate-like attaching portion <b>103</b><i>c </i>protruding laterally from the upper end of the arm portion <b>103</b><i>b</i>, and the attaching portion <b>103</b><i>c </i>is fixed to the vehicle body <b>104</b> by bolting or welding.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Moreover, JP 2008-141822A (Patent Document 2) proposes a clamp (holder) for attaching a pipe to a vehicle body. In a clamp <b>106</b> made of a resin molded article, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(A) and 6(B)</figref>, clamp portion <b>107</b> having a receiving recessed portion <b>107</b><i>a </i>for containing a pipe <b>105</b>, and a lid portion <b>108</b> for closing an opening of the receiving recessed portion <b>107</b><i>a </i>are coupled with a hinge <b>109</b>. A fixing portion <b>107</b><i>d </i>for being attached to the vehicle body (not shown) projects from the clamp portion <b>107</b>. The clamp has a structure in which, when the lid portion <b>108</b> is closed by inserting a locking claw <b>108</b><i>b </i>provided on the lid portion <b>108</b> into a locking hole <b>107</b><i>b </i>provided on the clamp portion <b>107</b> and locking it thereto, a lever piece <b>108</b><i>c </i>provided on the lid portion <b>108</b> abuts against a lever piece receiving portion <b>107</b><i>c </i>provided on the clamp portion <b>107</b> and the inner diameter of the receiving recessed portion <b>107</b><i>a </i>is reduced.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inner diameter of the cylindrical portion <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the bracket <b>103</b> described in Patent Document 1 is set to a predetermined value adjusted to the size of the outer diameter of the metal pipe <b>102</b> for being inserted thereinto. Moreover, also in the clamp <b>106</b> described in Patent Document 2, when the lid portion <b>108</b> is closed, the inner diameter of the receiving recessed portion <b>107</b><i>a </i>is set to a predetermined value adjusted to the size of the outer diameter of the pipe <b>105</b> for being inserted thereinto. Meanwhile, variations are exhibited in the outer diameters of the pipes <b>102</b> and <b>105</b> for being inserted into the bracket <b>103</b> and the clamp <b>106</b> in the range of a predetermined tolerance even if they have the same size of the outer diameters. Some types of the pipes have a large outer diameter tolerance. The bracket <b>103</b> and the clamp <b>106</b> do not have the structures capable of absorbing the outer diameter tolerance, and therefore, if the pipe <b>102</b> and <b>105</b> having the outer diameters close to allowable lower limit values are inserted into the bracket <b>103</b> and the clamp <b>106</b> having the above-described configurations, there are cases where gaps are formed between the inner circumferential surfaces of the bracket <b>103</b> and the clamp <b>106</b> into which the pipe <b>102</b> and <b>105</b> are inserted, and the outer circumferential surfaces of the pipe <b>102</b> and <b>105</b>, so that the pipe <b>102</b> and <b>105</b> vibrate and abnormal noises occur.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to absorb an outer diameter tolerance of a metal pipe for being inserted into a clamp and prevent vibrations of the metal pipe and occurrence of abnormal noises.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To solve the above-described problems, the present invention provides a clamp made of a resin molded article for attaching a pipe harness in which electric wires are inserted into a metal pipe to a vehicle body, having a configuration in which a first portion and second portion having a pair of semicircular inner surfaces are coupled with a thin-walled hinge, a locking portion and a locked portion are provided on free ends of the first and the second portions, the locking portion and the locked portion being lockable to each other, clamping the metal pipe inserted between the semicircular inner surfaces of the first and the second portions, and</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a configuration in which an attaching hole into which an attaching member protruding from the vehicle body can be inserted and locked thereto is provided on the first portion, an opening is provided in part of a partition portion that separates the attaching hole and the semicircular inner surfaces, a swinging piece projects into the opening from part of a circumferential surface of the partition portion surrounding the opening, an attaching member contact projection is provided on one side of the swinging piece, and a squeezing rib projects from the other side,</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">when the attaching member is inserted into the attaching hole the attaching member pushes against the attaching member contact projection and causes the squeezing rib to protrude to the semicircular inner surface side, and the squeezing rib is pushed against the metal pipe inserted along the semicircular inner surface, fixing the metal pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, in the clamp in which the first and the second portions having a pair of semicircular inner surfaces are coupled with the thin-walled hinge and the metal pipe of the pipe harness is inserted and clamped between the pair of semicircular inner surfaces, the opening is provided in the partition portion that separates the attaching hole of the first portion into which the attaching member protruding from the vehicle body is inserted and locked thereto and the semicircular inner surface, and the swinging piece projects to the opening from part of circumferential surfaces of the partition portion surrounding the opening. Moreover, the attaching member contact projection that is contacted and pressed by the attaching member when the attaching member on the vehicle body side is inserted into the attaching hole and locked thereto is provided on one side of the swinging piece, and the squeezing rib projects from the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, even if an outer diameter tolerance of the metal pipe for being inserted between the pair of the semicircular inner surfaces of the first and the second portions is relatively large and the outer diameter of the metal pipe is the allowable lower limit value, by merely inserting the attaching member on the vehicle body side into the attaching hole and locking it thereto, the attaching member contact projection of the swinging piece is pressed by the attaching member causing the squeezing rib to protrude toward the semicircular inner surface and the squeezing rib is pushed against the metal pipe, so that the metal pipe can be firmly fixed in the clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">That is, with the above-described configuration, the swinging piece for being pressed by the attaching member on the vehicle body side swings corresponding to the outer diameter of the metal pipe and allows the squeezing ribs to come into areal contact with the metal pipe, and therefore, an outer diameter tolerance of the metal pipe can be readily absorbed to prevent vibrations of the metal pipe and occurrence of abnormal noises. Since the load to the clamp is reduced by preventing vibrations of the metal pipe, the clamp is also prevented from breakage.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, since the metal pipe is fixed in the clamp without rattling by pushing the squeezing rib of the swinging piece against the metal pipe, the diameters of the pair of the semicircular inner surfaces of the first and the second portions can be set a little larger than the outer diameter of the metal pipe for being inserted thereinto. Accordingly, until the attaching member protruding from the vehicle body is inserted into the attaching hole of the clamp and locked thereto, it is possible to freely move the clamp in the axial direction of the metal pipe in accordance with the layout and the like of the vehicle body to change the position of the clamp. The attaching member is inserted into the attaching hole of the clamp and locked thereto, so that the position of the clamp can be fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is preferable that the swinging piece projects through a hinge from part of circumferential surfaces of the partition portion surrounding the opening in order to facilitate swinging. Moreover, it is preferable that the opening has a rectangular shape and the swinging piece projects through a hinge on a circumferential surface of the partition portion surrounding the opening, the circumferential surface being located in front of the opening with respect to the direction in which the attaching member to be inserted into the attaching hole and locked thereto is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is preferable that the attaching member protruding from the vehicle body is a stud bolt, a locking piece for being locked to a groove of the stud bolt projects from the inner surface of the attaching hole, and the attaching member contact projection of the swinging piece is pushed by the outer circumferential surface of the stud bolt inserted into the attaching hole.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, the attaching member protruding from the vehicle body may be a bracket in which a locking hole is provided, a locking claw for being inserted into the locking hole and locked thereto may project from the inner surface of the attaching hole having a shape allowing the bracket to be inserted thereinto, and the attaching member contact projection of the swinging piece may be pushed by the outer circumferential surface of the bracket inserted into the attaching hole.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is preferable that a plurality of the squeezing ribs provided on the swinging piece protrudes in parallel from a substrate of the swinging piece, the squeezing ribs protrude in V-shape toward respective tips, and the tips are squeezed by the metal pipe pressed against them.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As described above, the plurality of the parallel squeezing ribs protrudes in V-shape toward the tips to allow the tips of the squeezing ribs to be easily squeezed and to come into highly areal contact with the metal pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Moreover, it is preferable that the visible outlines of the tips of the plurality of the squeezing ribs have an arc shape in order to allow the squeezing ribs to come into areal contact with the arc-shaped outer peripheral line of the metal pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is preferable that the protruding amount of the squeezing ribs is set so that the squeezing ribs are pushed against the metal pipe, so that the metal pipe can be fixed even if the outer diameter of the metal pipe to be inserted between the pair of the semicircular inner surfaces of the first and the second portions is the allowable lower limit value.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is preferable that the locked portions comprising locking frames are provided on both lateral sides of the free end of the first portion, and the locking portions comprising locking claws for being inserted into the locking frames and locked thereto are provided on both lateral sides of the free end of the second portion.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is preferable that the clamp attaches the pipe harness for being arranged under a floor of a hybrid car or an electric car to an undersurface of a floor panel, and that the electric wires of the pipe harness connect a battery and an inverter, or an inverter and a motor.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As described above, in the present invention, the clamp in which the first and the second portions having a pair of semicircular inner surfaces are coupled with the thin-walled hinge and the metal pipe of the pipe harness is inserted and clamped between the pair of semicircular inner surfaces has a configuration in which the opening is provided in the partition portion that separates the attaching hole of the first portion into which an attaching member protruding from the vehicle body is inserted and locked thereto and the semicircular inner surface, and the swinging piece projects to the opening from part of circumferential surfaces of the partition portion surrounding the opening. Moreover, the clamp has a configuration in which the attaching member contact projection that is contacted and pressed by the attaching member when the attaching member on the vehicle body side is inserted into the attaching hole and locked thereto are provided on one side of the swinging piece, and the squeezing ribs project from the other side. Accordingly, even if an outer diameter tolerance of the metal pipe for being inserted between the pair of the semicircular inner surfaces of the first and the second portions is relatively large and the outer diameter of the metal pipe is the allowable lower limit value, by merely inserting the attaching member on the vehicle body side into the attaching hole and locking it thereto, the attaching member contact projection of the swinging piece is pressed by the attaching member causing the squeezing rib to protrude toward the semicircular inner surface and the squeezing rib is pushed against the metal pipe, so that the metal pipe can be firmly fixed in the clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">That is, with the above-described configuration, the swinging piece for being pressed by the attaching member on the vehicle body side swings corresponding to the outer diameter of the metal pipe and allows the squeezing ribs to come into areal contact with the metal pipe, and therefore, an outer diameter tolerance of the metal pipe can be readily absorbed to prevent vibrations of the metal pipe and occurrence of abnormal noises. Because the load to the clamp is reduced by preventing vibrations of the metal pipe, the clamp is also prevented from breakage.</p>
