<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The field of the disclosure relates generally to search and rescue operations, and more specifically, to retrieving personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Due to unforeseen circumstances, personnel may become stranded in an unfamiliar and/or hostile location. Such personnel typically need to be rescued and/or retrieved from the unfamiliar and/or hostile location. Before the personnel can be retrieved, however, the feasibility of the rescue operation is often evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To determine the feasibility of a rescue operation, several different variables may be considered. For example, the status, condition, and/or exact location of the personnel are generally determined. Furthermore, the proximity and intensity of hostile activity around the personnel may be considered. For example, hostile forces aware of the stranded personnel may attempt to ambush any attempted rescue operation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, given the state of the personnel and hostile activity, a proposed rescue operation that is likely to result in further casualties and/or injuries may not progress beyond an initial planning state, or may be canceled while underway. Accordingly, at least some known systems and method for personnel retrieval typically will not be used in a relatively risky and/or hostile personnel retrieval scenario.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a method for retrieving personnel is provided. The method includes receiving a radio signal indicating a real-time position of personnel to be retrieved, deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle to the real-time position, receiving an indication that the personnel to be retrieved is on-board the unmanned aerial vehicle, and operating the unmanned aerial vehicle to move the personnel to a different location.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, a personnel extraction system is provided.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The systems and methods described herein facilitate retrieving personnel. A user operates a hand held radio to communicate with an unmanned aerial vehicle and a command center. When the command center authorizes communication between the unmanned aerial vehicle and the hand held radio, the hand held radio transmits information indicating a position of the user to the unmanned aerial vehicle. The unmanned aerial vehicle uses the position information to travel to the location of the user. Once the unmanned aerial vehicle reaches the user, the user boards a rescue pod attached to the unmanned aerial vehicle, and the unmanned aerial vehicle transports the rescue pod and the user to a different location. As used herein, &#x201c;personnel&#x201d; refers to any person and/or persons (e.g., civilian, military, etc.) that may be retrieved using the systems and methods described herein.</p>
