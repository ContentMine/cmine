      <p>A system and corresponding method for a launch vehicle or spacecraft for releasably
         connecting a first body (
         <b>100</b>) with a first interface (
         <b>101</b>) and a second body (
         <b>200</b>) with a second matching interface (
         <b>201</b>), said system comprising: a belt (
         <b>300</b>) for releasably securing said first body (
         <b>100</b>) to said second body (
         <b>200</b>); a circumferential trench (
         <b>203</b>) at said second interface (
         <b>201</b>) for receiving said belt (
         <b>300</b>) in order to provide for a fixation of said belt (
         <b>300</b>) with relation to said second body (
         <b>200</b>); mechanical fixation means (
         <b>301</b>) attaching said belt (
         <b>300</b>) to said first body (
         <b>100</b>), said mechanical fixation means (
         <b>301</b>) being provided to enable a circumferential shifting movement of said belt (
         <b>300</b>) with respect to said circumference of said first body (
         <b>100</b>) in order to initiate a separation of the first body (
         <b>100</b>) from the second body (
         <b>200</b>), wherein said circumferential shifting movement induces a relative movement of said
         belt (
         <b>300</b>) with respect to said circumference of said first body (
         <b>100</b>) in order to remove said belt (

         <b>203</b>), and wherein the system further comprising a releasing mechanism (
         <b>303</b>) causing said circumferential shifting movement.

         <h1>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a zero-shock separation system for a launch vehicle
            or spacecraft for releasably connecting a first body with a second body, especially
            for connecting a payload fairing to the body of a launch vehicle or spacecraft.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is a common requirement for spacecrafts that two bodies, also called stages have
            to be releasably connected to each other. Due to the extreme conditions during takeoff
            and flight, these connections have to be extremely stable but at the same time a quick
            and reliable separation of the two bodies has to be ensured.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">In known separation systems, the first body, e.g. the payload fairing is connected
            to the second body, e.g. the body of the launch vehicle or spacecraft by the use of
            a pre-tensioned belt which is released/cut/disengaged when release of the first body
            from the second body is needed. This release is usually initiated once the launch
            vehicle or payload has reached a predetermined altitude/orbit.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when such a pre-tensioned belt is suddenly released/cut/disengaged, a strong,
            undesirable shock arises which is transmitted to the launch vehicle or payload. Such
            a shock can be dangerous since it might affect the integrity or the trajectory of
            the launch vehicle or payload.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, due to the size of the two bodies that needs to be releasably connected,
            the pre-tensioning of the belt, as it is conventionally done, might prove to be a
            difficult task. Additionally, said tension in the belt might even cause an undesirable
            deformation of one of the two bodies.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>Technical Problem to be Solved</h1>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The objective of the present invention is thus to eliminate these disadvantages and
            to provide a system for a launch vehicle or spacecraft for releasably connecting a
            first body with a second body wherein the separation of the two bodies can be initiated
            without causing a shock. A further objective of the present invention is to eliminate
            the difficult step of pre-tension the belt during connection of the two bodies. An
            even further objective of the present invention is to ensure that neither of the two
            bodies connected suffers a deformation due to the connection.
         </p>

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-identified objective of the present invention is solved by a system for
            a launch vehicle or spacecraft for releasably connecting a first body with a first
            interface and a second body with a second matching interface, said system comprising:
            a belt for releasably securing said first body to said second body, a circumferential
            trench at said second interface for receiving at least a circumferential portion of
            said belt in order to provide for a fixation of said circumferential portion of said
            belt with relation to said second body, further comprising mechanical fixation means
            attaching said circumferential portion of said belt to a circumference of said first
            body, said mechanical fixation means being provided to enable a circumferential shifting
            movement of said circumferential portion of said belt with respect to said circumference
            of said first body in order to initiate a separation of the first body from the second
            body, said circumferential shifting movement inducing a relative movement of said
            circumferential portion of said belt with respect to said circumference of said first
            body in order to remove said circumferential portion of said belt from said trench,
            and comprising a releasing mechanism causing said circumferential shifting movement.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above-identified objective of the present invention is also solved by a method
            for a launch vehicle or spacecraft for releasably connecting a first body with a first
            interface and a second body with a second matching interface, the method comprising
            the steps of: providing a belt for releasably securing said first body to said second
            body; providing a circumferential trench at said second interface for receiving at
            least a portion of said belt in order to provide for a fixation of said portion of
            said belt with relation to said second body; attaching said portion of said belt to
            a circumference of said first body by mechanical fixation means; causing a circumferential
            shifting movement of said portion of said belt with respect to said circumference
            of said first body in order to initiate a separation of the first body from the second
            body, by means of a releasing mechanism; wherein said circumferential shifting movement
            induces a relative movement of said portion of said belt with respect to said circumference
            of said first body in order to axially remove said portion of said belt from said
            trench.

         <h1>Advantageous Effects</h1>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the drawbacks of the prior art, the objective of the present invention
            and the inventive solution summarized above, the present invention has the main advantage
            that the separation of the two bodies can be initiated in a smooth way, without a
            shock or sudden vibration and without the need of pre-tensioning the belt.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further advantage of the present invention is that the assembly/connection of the
            two bodies is significantly simplified by elimination of the difficult step of pre-tensioning
            the belt.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">An even further advantage of the present invention is that deformation of either of
            the two bodies due to the connection is excluded.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0043" num="0042">It shall be noted that the figures are not drawn to scale and that certain details
            have been drawn out of scale for clarity.
