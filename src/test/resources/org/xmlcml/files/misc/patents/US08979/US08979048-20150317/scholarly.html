         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject invention relates to improvements in mounts for portable electronic displays,
            and more particularly, to a rotating adapter for mounting a portable electronic flight
            bag (EFB) on a supporting surface within the cockpit of an aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">An EFB is an electronic display device that a pilot may use for preflight check lists
            and similar activities. EFB's are generally handheld, portable devices that a pilot
            can take from flight to flight. Information about a pilot's flight may be preloaded
            onto the EFB so that the pilot can access it prior to, during and after the flight.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the past, a pilot may have simply placed an EFB loosely within the cockpit of an
            airplane, e.g., on the floor or on a console, which could lead to problems during
            the flight. For example, the EFB could become lost among other items in the cockpit,
            or the position of the EFB might shift during the flight. Further, if there is turbulence,
            the EFB could become damaged if it is not secured to a fixed surface within the cockpit.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">Partially in response to these concerns, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
            (FAA) has published guidelines designating three separate classes of EFB hardware
            approved for use under progressively more demanding conditions. Specifically, Class
            1 devices are standard commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment such as laptops or
            handheld electronic devices. These devices are used as loose equipment and are typically
            stowed during critical phases of flight. A Class 1 EFB is considered a Portable Electronic
            Device (PED). These may connect to aircraft power and interface to other systems via
            certified (STC) docking station and/or power source. This would allow the Class 1
            device to interface with other systems through the certified interface and other devices
            through an expansion port interface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Class 2 devices are also Portable Electronic Devices, and range from modified COTS
            equipment to purpose-built devices. They are typically mounted in the aircraft with
            the display being viewable to the pilot during all phases of flight. Mounts can include
            certified structural mounting devices or kneeboard devices. These devices may connect
            to aircraft power and data sources, e.g. through an ARINC 429 interface. A Class 2
            EFB can be used for bi-directional data communication with other aircraft systems.
            In this class, a single line replaceable unit (LRU) would be an optimal solution based
            on the ease of installation and replacement.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Class 3 devices are considered “installed equipment” and are subject to airworthiness
            requirements defined by the FAA. Unlike PEDs, these devices must be under design control.
            The hardware is subject to a limited number of RTCA DO-160E requirements (for non-essential
            equipment—typical crash safety and Conducted and Radiated Emissions (EMC) testing).
            There may also be certain requirements for software. Class 3 EFBs are typically installed
            under STC or other airworthiness approval.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">Mounting brackets used for Class 2 and Class 3 hardware typically do not permit easy
            removal of the electronic equipment. The orientation and/or position of the electronic
            equipment also cannot be easily changed to accommodate user preference. Those mounting
            brackets that do permit adjustment, require considerable manipulation with both hands,
            which can be distracting and inconvenient for the pilot or other operator.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">It would be beneficial to provide a mounting assembly that allows for easy temporary
            installation of a Class 2 EFB on a supporting console within the cockpit of an aircraft
            without the use of any tools, fasteners or complicated moving parts.

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The subject invention is directed to a new and useful assembly for mounting an electronic
            display device to a supporting structure, such as a console, within the cockpit of
            an aircraft. The assembly incudes an adapter portion configured for attachment to
            a rear surface of the electronic display device and a base portion configured to be
            mounted to a fixed structure, such as a console, in the cockpit of the aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">The adapter portion of the mounting assembly has a mounting plate for securement to
            the rear surface of the display device with a plurality of fasteners, and a cylindrical
            barrel portion that extends away from the rear surface of the display device. The
            barrel portion has three circumferentially disposed radially outwardly extending keys.
            The barrel portion further includes a first radially inwardly extending recess corresponding
            to a landscape position of the display device and a second radially inwardly extending
            recess corresponding to a portrait position of the display device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">The base portion of the mounting assembly includes an upper surface or wall with a
            circular reception port formed therein for receiving the barrel of the adapter portion.
            The reception port has three radially outwardly extending circumferentially disposed
            keyways formed therein for receiving the three corresponding keys formed on the barrel
            of the adapter portion.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, the mounting assembly includes a manually operated plunger operatively
            associated with the base portion for selectively engaging the first and second recesses
            in the barrel of the adapter portion to prevent relative rotation of the adapter portion
            and the base portion. A locking nut is also provided for selectively securing the
            plunger in an engagement position relative to the base portion.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the three keys and keyways are positioned so that an initial engagement
            position of the barrel within the reception port corresponds to the display device
            having an orientation that is 30° clockwise from the landscape position of the display
            device and 120° clockwise from the portrait position of the display device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">The barrel preferably includes a circumferential slot that is located axially above
            the three keys for engaging an annular retaining lip that surrounds the reception
            port in the upper surface of the base portion. The adapter portion also includes a
            plurality of spring loaded plungers retained in the barrel and mounted to bear against
            a bottom plate of the base portion to provide pressure against the retaining lip to
            add resistance against the rotation of the barrel within the reception port.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">These and other features of the mounting assembly of the subject invention and the
            manner in which it is employed within the cockpit of an aircraft will become more
            readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art from the following enabling
            description of the preferred embodiments of the subject invention taken in conjunction

         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals identify similar structural
            features or aspects of the subject invention, there is illustrated in figref[FIG. 1]
            	 an electronic display device 
            <b>10</b> that a pilot may use for preflight check lists and similar activities within the
            cockpit of an aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">The electronic display device 
            <b>10</b> is removably mounted to a supporting structure or console 
            <b>12</b> in the cockpit of an aircraft using the mounting assembly of the subject invention,
            which is described in greater detail herein below. The mounting assembly of the subject
            invention enables a pilot to easily and quickly mount the electronic display device
            
            <b>10</b> to a supporting surface or console 
            <b>12</b> in the cockpit of an aircraft without any tools, fasteners or latches.

         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to figref[FIGS. 2 and 3]
            	, there is shown the mounting assembly of the subject invention, which is designated
            generally by reference numeral 
            <b>100</b>. Mounting assembly 
            <b>100</b> includes two main components. These components include an adapter portion

            <b>12</b> or other fixed structure in the cockpit of an aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">The adapter portion 
            <b>110</b> of mounting assembly 
            <b>100</b> has a mounting plate or flange 
            <b>112</b> having a plurality of apertures 
            <b>114</b> formed therein. The apertures 
            <b>114</b> accommodate threaded fasteners (not shown) that are used to secure the adapter portion
            
            <b>110</b> to the rear surface of the display device 
            <b>10</b>. A cylindrical barrel portion

            <b>130</b>, 
            <b>132</b> does not have to be a 90° arc. Indeed, the extent of the arc between the recesses
            may depend upon the configuration of the cockpit or the structure of the console.
            For example, there may be cases where a 45° or 50° degree rotation is adequate to
            change the perception of portrait versus landscape and vice versa.
