         <h1>BACKGROUND ART</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">figref[FIG. 12]
            	 shows the conventional external material clamping structure for fixing the external
            material 
            <b>50</b> to the foundation 
            <b>60</b> of the wall of the building with the external material clamp A. (Refer to Patent
            Literature 1 hereinafter explained) The external material clamp A comprises a fixed
            plate 
            <b>1</b>, a horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b>, an upper support plate 
            <b>3</b>, and a lower support plate 
            <b>4</b>. The horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b> extends to a front direction from a center of the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b>. The upper support plate extends to an upper direction from a front end of the horizontal
            plate 
            <b>2</b>. The lower support plate 
            <b>4</b> extends to the lower direction from the front end of the horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b>. The external material clamp A is fixed to the foundation 
            <b>60</b> of the wall of the building with the fixation member 
            <b>61</b> such as the nail and the screw under the condition where the fixation member 
            <b>61</b> passes through the fixation hole 
            <b>10</b> of the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b>. The external material 
            <b>50</b> is inserted at its lower engagement portion 
            <b>53</b> into the space between the upper support plate 
            <b>3</b> and the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> of the external material clamp A, whereby the engagement between the lower engagement
            portion 
            <b>53</b> of the external material 
            <b>50</b> and the space is established. In addition, the external material 
            <b>50</b> is inserted at its upper engagement portion 
            <b>54</b> into the space between the lower support plate 
            <b>4</b> and the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> of another external material clamp A, whereby the engagement between the upper engagement
            portion 
            <b>54</b> of the external material and the space is established. According to repeating the
            above work to fix a plurality of the external materials in the vertical direction,
            the exterior wall of the building is formed. In addition, the upstanding member 
            <b>11</b> is formed to project to a front direction from both lateral portion of the fixed
            plate 
            <b>1</b>. Consequently, the external material 
            <b>50</b> is fixed to the foundation of the wall 
            <b>60</b> to leave a ventilation space 
            <b>62</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the above external material clamping structure, the external material in an upper
            side is disposed such that the load of the external material in an upper side is applied
            to the upper surface of the external material in a lower side. That is, the lower
            end of the external material 
            <b>50</b> is provided with a cover 
            <b>51</b> which extends to the lower direction to cover the lower support plate 
            <b>4</b> of the external material clamp A. The lower surface of the cover 
            <b>51</b> is in a contact with the contact surface of an upper end of the external material
            in the lower side. The load of the external material of the upper side is applied
            to the contact portion of the external material 
            <b>50</b> of the lower side.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the external material clamping structure, there is a possibility of applying
            large load to the external material 
            <b>50</b> of the lower side. Especially, when attaching a plurality of the external material
            
            <b>50</b> in the vertical direction, the external material 
            <b>50</b> in a lower side of the wall receives the load of a plurality of the external materials
            
            <b>50</b>. That is, the large load is applied to the external material 
            <b>50</b> in the lower side of the wall. Applying the large load to the exterior wall 
            <b>50</b> causes the problem such as the breakage and the deformation of the external material
            
            <b>50</b>.

         <h1>Advantageous Effects of Invention</h1>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">This invention discloses the external material clamp which comprises a receiving plate.
            At least a part of the receiving plate is located above the horizontal plate. Therefore,
            a part of the load of the external material in the upper side is supported by the
            receiving plate. Consequently, it is possible to fix a plurality of the external materials
            with prevention of applying the excess load to the external material in the lower
            side. Therefore, even if the large load is caused by fixing and arranging a plurality
            of the external materials in the vertical direction, it is possible to prevent the
            breakage and the deformation of the external material. That is, the load of the external
            material in the upper side is shared by “the external material in the lower side”
            and “the receiving plate of the external material clamp”. Therefore, applying the
            excess load to the external material in the lower side is prevented. Further, the
            receiving plate receives a part of the load of the external material. Therefore, there
            is no possibility that only the receiving plate receives the excess load. So, it is
            possible to damage the foundation of the wall. Consequently, applying the excess load
            to the external material as well as applying the load to the foundation of the wall
            is prevented. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the breakage and the deformation
            of the external material.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, the receiving plate is realized by the receiving support plate which
            is formed by cutting out the upper support plate. Therefore, additional work is not
            required, compared with a case where the receiving plate is formed by the separate
            components. Therefore, it is possible to easily form the receiving plate.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, the receiving plate is realized by the receiving horizontal plate which
            is formed by cutting out a horizontal plate. Consequently, there is no need to perform
            additional work if the receiving plate is formed by the separate components. Therefore,
            it is possible to easily form the receiving plate.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, the receiving plate is realized by the receiving fixed plate which is
            formed by cutting out a part of the fixed plate. Consequently, there is no need to
            perform additional work if the receiving plate is formed by the separate components.
            Therefore, it is possible to easily form the receiving plate.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, the lower support plate is provided with the fixing support plate projected
            to the fixed plate from the lower support plate. Therefore, an upper end portion of
            the external material in the lower side is held and fixed between the fixing support
            plate and the fixed plate. Therefore, it is possible to support the external material
            with reducing the backlash.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, the structure uses the external material clamp with the receiving plate.
            A load of the external material in the upper side is shared by “the receiving plate
            of the external material clamp” and “The external material in the lower side”. Therefore,
            it is possible to prevent the excess load from being applied to the external material.
            Furthermore, the receiving plate receives a part of the load of the external material.
            Therefore, there is no possibility that the excess load is applied to only the receiving
            plate, whereby there is no possibility of damaging the foundation of the wall. Therefore,
            it is possible to prevent both “the applying the load to the foundation of the wall”
            and “applying excess load to the receiving plate”. Therefore, it is possible to prevent
            the breakage and the deformation of the external material.

            <b>1</b> is provided with the fixation hole 
            <b>10</b> which is used when the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> is fixed to the foundation 
            <b>60</b> of the wall by the fixation member 
            <b>61</b> such as nail and the screw. The fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> is provided at its upper end with a fixation rib 
            <b>21</b>. The fixation rib 
            <b>21</b> is provided for reinforce the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b>. The fixation rib 
            <b>21</b> is formed over a lateral direction of the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b>. The fixation rib 
            <b>21</b> is a bending portion of the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> to have an L-shaped cross section so as to be projected to the front direction. The
            fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> is provided at its lower end with a fixation rib 
            <b>22</b>. The fixation rib

            <b>11</b> is projected to the front direction to have a projection length which is shorter
            than the projection length of the horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b>. The projection members 
            <b>11</b> are provided for leaving the aeration space 
            <b>62</b> between “the foundation 
            <b>60</b> of the wall” and “The external material

            of the projection-front plate 
            <b>12</b> such that the projection-side plate is approximately perpendicular to the projection-front
            plate 
            <b>12</b>. The upper end and the lower end of the upstanding member 
            <b>11</b> are formed to have smoothly-curved surfaces which connect the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> with the projection-front plate 
            <b>12</b> and the projection-side plate 
            <b>13</b> smoothly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0074" num="0073">The horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b> is formed to project to the front direction from the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> to be approximately perpendicular to the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b>. The horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b> is projected to have the projection length which is greater than the projection length
            of the upstanding member 
            <b>11</b>. Consequently, as shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	, the lower engagement member 
            <b>53</b> of the external material 
            <b>50</b> is inserted into and engaged with the space between the upstanding member 
            <b>11</b> and the upper support plate 
            <b>3</b>. Further, the upper engagement member 
            <b>54</b> of the external material 
            <b>50</b> in the lower side is inserted into and engaged with the space between the upstanding
            member 
            <b>11</b> and the lower support plate 
            <b>4</b>. Consequently, supporting and attaching the external materials 
            <b>50</b> in the vertical direction is established. The horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b> and the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> have a boundary portion therebetween. The boundary portion is provided at its both
            lateral ends with horizontal ribs 
            <b>23</b>, respectively. The horizontal ribs 
            <b>23</b> are provided for reinforce the strength between the horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b> and the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b>. As shown in figref[FIG. 3]
            	 C, the horizontal rib 
            <b>23</b> is formed to project upper-front direction. In addition, the horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b> is provided at its center with a horizontal projection member 
            <b>14</b>. The horizontal projection member 
            <b>14</b> is projected to the upper direction. The top of the horizontal projection member
            
            <b>14</b> has an approximately flat surface. The horizontal projection member 
            <b>14</b> acts as the rib to reinforce the strength of the horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b>. The horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b> is required to have a form such that the horizontal plate 
            <b>2</b> engages with two external materials in the vertical direction. Therefore, the horizontal
            plate 
            <b>2</b> may be inclined to extend in a direction such as obliquely-upper direction and obliquely-lower
            direction. That is to say, there is no need for the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> to be perpendicular to the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b>.

            <b>50</b> is improved its insertability into the space between the fixed plate 
            <b>1</b> and the upper support plate

            and a second section which is bent to extend to the lower direction from the first
            section. The lower support rib
