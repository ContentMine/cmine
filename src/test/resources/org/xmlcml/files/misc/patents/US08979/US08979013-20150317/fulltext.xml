<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a rapid tearing device of a strip in a rewinding machine.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the field of machines suitable for the formation of rolls or &#x201c;logs&#x201d; of paper destined for the preparation of toilet paper, blotting paper and/or similar products, rewinding machines are envisaged, which wind the continuous paper coming from a large paper roll, onto cores. For the production of paper rolls, in fact, there is a feeding of a continuous strip of paper material along a pre-defined route. It should be noted that the continuous strip, after starting its unwinding in a certain course, encounters a punching group whereby it is provided with transversal perforation lines to facilitate breakage and consequently the tearing of short sections of paper having a predetermined length.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The continuous strip therefore contains a series of transversal perforated weakening lines, parallel to each other and spaced at regular intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The continuous strip thus treated, is introduced into the rewinding machine, where it is wound onto a cardboard supporting core, tubular in form, externally having a pre-determined portion of glue along a generatrix of the core.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The rotation of the core by means of a group of winding rolls causes the winding of the continuous strip until the respective roll or &#x201c;log&#x201d; of wrapping paper has been formed. As already mentioned, at the beginning of the winding, a piece of the strip is joined to the core by means of glue positioned on the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At the end of the winding of a predetermined amount of continuous paper strip, the tail of the log must be separated thus contemporaneously creating the head of a new log to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The separation operation of the continuous strip is effected, for example, by means of tearing which causes the breakage of the continuous strip along one of the perforated lines produced on the paper and mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This separation can be effected in various ways and using various devices. The tearing action of the continuous strip can be effected, for example, by varying the rotation rate of the winding rolls so as to create a section of strip sufficient for causing its breakage along a respective transversal perforated line.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Alternatively, in EP 1618057, the tearing of the continuous strip is effected by the high-pressure blowing of a fluid against the perforated line in order to cause its breakage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Comb- or buffer-elements are also envisaged, which intervene on the strip near a perforation line and block the paper on the upper winding cylinder in order to effect the above-mentioned separation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Even if the above systems and methods for the separation of the continuous strip of paper material allow the desired breakage of the paper to be effected along the transversal perforated line selected, these methods are either particularly complex or they generate folds on the paper and problems downstream during rewinding.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The general objective of the present invention is to solve the above-mentioned drawbacks of the known art in a simple, economical and particularly functional way.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another objective of the invention is to provide device for the rapid tearing of a strip in a rewinding machine which does not cause folds on the paper which is being wound onto the core.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Yet another objective of the invention is to provide a device for the rapid tearing of a strip in a rewinding machine which causes the least possible waste of paper being wound before the paper adheres to the glue carried by the core.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further objective of the present invention is to provide a device for the rapid tearing of a strip in a rewinding machine which does not use buffers or, in any case, does not exploit the combined action with the upper winding roll.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In view of the above objectives, according to the present invention, a device has been conceived for the rapid tearing of a strip in a rewinding machine having the characteristics indicated in the enclosed claims.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this substantially illustrates the core of a rewinding machine in which a rapid tearing device of a continuous strip of paper according to the invention, is positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The rewinding machine at which a continuous strip of paper <b>11</b> arrives, such as, for example, toilet paper, blotting paper and/or other types of paper materials, essentially comprises an area in which the rolls or logs <b>12</b> of paper are prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A conveyor <b>13</b> equipped with pushers <b>14</b> for the advancing of cores <b>15</b>, made of cardboard for example, is positioned upstream of this area for the formation of the log.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The end of the conveyor <b>13</b> faces a channel <b>16</b> defined by a series of cradles <b>17</b> integral with the structure of the rewinder.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An upper winding roll <b>18</b> is positioned above the channel <b>16</b>, or cradles <b>17</b>, whereas a lower winding roll <b>19</b> is situated almost at the end of the cradles <b>17</b>. A third oscillating roll <b>20</b> is positioned above the lower winding roll <b>19</b>, cooperating with it and with the upper winding roll and acting as a press with a variation in the dimension of the log <b>12</b> being formed between the three mentioned rolls <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cores <b>15</b>, carried by the conveyor <b>13</b> by means of the pushers <b>14</b>, are previously provided with sections of glue <b>21</b>, situated in correspondence with the area where the finger on a watch indicates nine. According to the present invention, a device according to the present invention is situated in a similar arrangement of the rewinder.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A pair of arms <b>22</b> are in fact envisaged, only one of which is shown, situated in opposite positions with respect to the ends of the rolls. The two arms <b>22</b> carry a cross-piece <b>23</b>, for example tubular, on which a blade <b>24</b> is positioned, arranged transversally with respect to the advancing of the paper, which has the same size as the width of the mentioned rolls <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> (size of the bench).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The blade <b>24</b> can be moved by means of actuators, between a stand-by position and an engagement position on a core <b>15</b>, when this core <b>15</b> is discharged by the conveyor <b>13</b> and introduced into the channel <b>16</b> so as to block, between the core <b>15</b> and blade <b>24</b>, the paper <b>11</b> which is being unwound and passing through this point.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The arms <b>22</b> oscillate around central pins <b>25</b> and two spring cylinders <b>27</b> are connected to these at a first end, in further pins <b>26</b>, the spring cylinders <b>27</b> being hinged in turn at the other end of the arms by means of pins <b>28</b> to the structure of the rewinder.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The cylinders <b>27</b> act as elastic means and operate so that the arms are pulled back according to the arrow <b>29</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, i.e. moved away from the upper roll <b>18</b> so that the blade <b>24</b> does not interfere with one of the cores <b>15</b> pushed forwards by the pushers <b>14</b> of the conveyor <b>13</b>, to be sent inside the channel <b>16</b>. Furthermore, they normally keep the feelers <b>30</b> in contact with a cam wheel <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The device of the invention also envisages that the arms <b>22</b> oscillate by means of a cam wheel&#x2014;movable feeler coupling in synchronism with a discharge introducer <b>34</b> of a core <b>15</b> from the conveyor <b>13</b> towards the channel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">More specifically, the cam wheel&#x2014;movable feeler coupling envisages that a feeler <b>30</b> be positioned at the end of the oscillating arms <b>22</b>, opposite to that where the blade <b>24</b> is situated. The feeler <b>30</b> is kept in contact with an outer surface of a cam wheel <b>31</b> positioned on the same axis <b>33</b> as a toothed wheel <b>32</b> which activates the movement of the conveyor <b>13</b>. In this way the above-mentioned actuating means of the blade <b>24</b> are produced.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, the cam wheel <b>31</b>, or toothed wheel <b>32</b>, carries at least one introducer <b>34</b> which discharges the core <b>15</b> carried by the pushers <b>14</b> of the conveyor <b>13</b> and introduces or inserts it at the inlet of channel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A cam portion <b>35</b> radially protruding outwardly from the cam wheel <b>31</b>, acts on the feeler <b>30</b> of the two arms <b>22</b> when a core <b>15</b> is introduced by the introducer <b>34</b> at the inlet of the channel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this way, the arms <b>22</b> oscillate clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to the arrow <b>36</b>, overcoming the force of the spring cylinders <b>27</b> and the core <b>15</b> is pressed between the blade <b>24</b>, the pusher <b>14</b> and the cradles <b>17</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this way, the paper <b>11</b> is also pressed between the walls in contact with each other, and stops. The paper <b>11</b> is torn in the transversal perforated line <b>37</b>, closest to the core <b>15</b>, due to the strong deceleration it undergoes as a result of the pressure of the core <b>15</b> on the blade <b>24</b> which has stopped in the maximum proximity position towards the conveyor <b>13</b>. In this way, the log <b>12</b>, in formation, is freed and can be removed from its grip between the rolls <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>. In addition, the head of the paper is created, which will be wound around the core <b>15</b> which is thus introduced into the channel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows how, by continuing the introduction of the core <b>15</b> into the channel <b>16</b> by means of the pusher <b>34</b>, the lengths of glue <b>21</b>, i.e. the glue, are put in contact with the paper <b>11</b> just before the head of the paper separated by the device of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a subsequent step, wherein the core <b>15</b>, with the respective glued paper <b>11</b>, is made to roll into the channel <b>16</b> by the action of the upper roll <b>18</b>, to be positioned between the rolls <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> of the rewinder to produce another log <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the meantime, in an immediately subsequent step to that of the tearing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the continuous rotation of the toothed wheel <b>32</b>, or cam wheel <b>31</b>, causes disengagement between the cam portion <b>35</b> of the cam wheel <b>31</b> and feeler <b>30</b> of the two arms <b>22</b>, with backward oscillation of the same arms brought back by the cylinders <b>27</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The originality of this device consists in the fact that, as in previous devices, there is no specific device (a buffer, for example) which slows down the paper and tears it in the point closest to the perforation, acting on the upper winding roll. It is, in fact, the same core <b>15</b> which, in collaboration with the blade <b>24</b> situated near the paper <b>11</b>, grips the paper and tears it.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The operative phases previously illustrated can be summarized by making reference to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the rewinding machine and the device of the invention appears in stand-by, whereby the introducer <b>34</b> does not act and the blade <b>24</b> is raised, far from the cores <b>15</b> and from the paper <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the core <b>15</b> is in an exchange phase, the introducer <b>34</b> is adjacent to it and the cam portion <b>35</b> of the cam wheel <b>31</b> is about to come into contact with the feeler <b>30</b> to make the arms <b>22</b> oscillate.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the introducer <b>34</b> is in movement and acts on the core <b>15</b>, the cam portion <b>25</b> moves the arms <b>22</b> and causes the blade <b>24</b> to descend and block the paper <b>11</b> which is torn in the closest point to the perforation after the core <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the core <b>15</b> enters the cradles <b>17</b> and is rotated by the upper roll <b>18</b>. In this way, the glue <b>21</b> is put, with the core, in contact with the paper <b>11</b> so as to form a new winding.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates more clearly how the log <b>12</b> formed between the rolls leaves the same and the wound core <b>15</b> is brought to the winding phase. It is also evident that the introducer <b>34</b> returns to the low disengagement position and another core <b>15</b> is moved forwards.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It can therefore be seen that the device of the invention is extremely simple and the capturing strip of the paper is extremely short and reduced to the minimum.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The objective mentioned in the preamble of the description has therefore been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The forms of the structure for the production of a device according to the invention, as also the materials and assembly modes, can obviously differ from those shown for purely illustrative and non-limiting purposes in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The protection scope of the present invention is therefore delimited by the enclosed claims.</p>
