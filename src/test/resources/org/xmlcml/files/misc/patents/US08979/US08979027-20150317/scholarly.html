      <p>A system for attaching a wall panel includes a wall panel and a lock strip. The wall
         panel has a back and a tab extending from the back. The lock strip is moveably attached
         to a wall frame member, and has a three-position locking slot, including a receiving
         portion configured to receive the tab, a locking portion configured to lock the tab
         with respect to the frame member, and a release portion configured to release the
         tab. The wall panel is removably attachable to the frame member by inserting the tab
         into the receiving portion and linearly moving the lock strip to lock the tab in the
         locking portion. The system can be used for attaching interior sidewall panels in
         an aircraft.

         <h1>FIELD</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to wall installation systems, such as for aircraft
            interior sidewalls. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a system
            and method for installing wall panels that is quick and secure and requires minimal
            tools, and which also facilitates later removal of wall sections while minimizing
            damage to the wall structure.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the
            present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modern commercial aircraft typically include a fuselage having a series of curved
            transverse ribs and longitudinal stringers. The exterior of the ribs and stringers
            are covered with a skin of aluminum, carbon fiber composite or other suitable material.
            The interior of the aircraft includes a series of curved sidewall panels that are
            attached to the inside of the ribs, typically by screws or other fasteners. The wall
            panels are typically of polymer material, and can include window frames and other
            structure that forms a part of the finished aircraft. Once wiring, insulation and
            other internal wall components are installed between the ribs and inside the skin,
            the interior wall panels are attached to cover the insulation and other internal wall
            components, such as environmental components, with a durable covering that provides
            a pleasing appearance.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typical aircraft sidewall panels require specialized tooling and hardware for installation,
            such as special screws, washers, screw drivers, panel installation support aids, shims,
            etc. In one common arrangement, a sidewall installation involves eight fasteners that
            attach to their respective frame mounting brackets. Some sidewall systems include
            mounting hardware (e.g. screws) that is shared between adjacent panels. Other sidewall
            systems avoid screws and fasteners by using keyways, slotted brackets and the like.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">With all of the elements of a typical sidewall installation, it can be a challenge
            to get the sidewall properly aligned rotationally, vertically and horizontally and
            then install all of the fasteners. For example, it is desirable to accurately adjust
            for the proper sidewall-to-center-of-window alignment, which may involve individually
            adjusting each one of multiple frame brackets, and centering the sidewall panel to
            align with the window before final fastening of each mounting screw. Even systems
            that include keyholes and brackets can involve individual adjustment of multiple brackets
            during installation. Consequently, typical sidewall installations involve more than
            one skilled worker and a significant amount of time to properly adjust the sidewall
            and install all of the fasteners. Adjusting and fastening several parts by hand is
            time-consuming. The work can present ergonomic an ergonomic environment that is less
            than desired. Moreover, even after such installations there can be issues with gaps,
            wrinkles and puckers in the panel, due to internal stresses induced during the installation
            process and other irregularities.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typical sidewall installations can also present challenges when removal of panels
            is desired. Certain aircraft maintenance and repair operations can involve the removal
            of one or more sidewall panels in an aircraft, in order to allow access to electrical,
            mechanical and other components inside the wall. With typical fastener-attached wall
            panels, removal of an existing panel presents a higher than desired chance of damage
            to the panel (perhaps resulting in costly replacement), and a higher than desired
            likelihood of misalignment or other defect when the panel is replaced. Panel systems
            that have shared fasteners between adjacent panels present other possible problems.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure is directed toward one or more of the above-mentioned issues.</p>

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a system for attaching a wall panel,
            including a wall panel, and a lock strip. The wall panel has a back and a tab extending
            from the back. The lock strip is moveably attached to a wall frame member, and has
            a three-position locking slot, including a receiving portion configured to receive
            the tab, a locking portion configured to lock the tab with respect to the frame member,
            and a release portion configured to release the tab. The wall panel is removably attachable
            to the frame member by inserting the tab into the receiving portion and linearly moving
            the lock strip to lock the tab in the locking portion.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one specific embodiment, the wall panel is an aircraft interior panel, and the
            frame member is a rib of an aircraft fuselage.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another specific embodiment, the tab comprises a substantially rigid, upstanding
            member having a distal bulb end configured to engage the receiving portion of the
            locking slot in a friction fit.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another specific embodiment, a spline having a channel is fixedly attached to the
            frame member, and the lock strip is moveably disposed in the channel.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another specific embodiment, the wall panel is removable from the frame by linearly
            moving the lock strip to align the release portion with the tab.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with another embodiment, the present disclosure provides an aircraft
            having an airframe and a fuselage with a plurality of substantially parallel frame
            members, a spline, fixedly attached to the frame members, an interior wall panel,
            and a lock strip, linearly moveably disposed in the spline. The wall panel has a back,
            with a plurality of tabs extending from the back. The lock strip has a plurality of
            three-position locking slots. Each locking slot includes a receiving portion, configured
            to receive a tab, a locking portion, configured to positionally lock the tab with
            respect to the frame member, and a release portion, configured to allow removal of
            the tab from the slot. The wall panel is removably attachable to the frame by inserting
            the plurality of tabs into the corresponding receiving portions, and linearly moving
            the lock strip to lock the tabs in the locking portions.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with yet another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method
            for installing a wall panel in an aircraft fuselage interior. The method includes
            inserting a plurality of tabs extending from a back of a wall panel into receiving
            portions of three-position moveable lock strips associated with at least two frame
            members of the fuselage, and linearly pulling the lock strips to align a locking portion
            of the locking slot of the lock strip with the tabs, thereby fixing the position of
            the wall panel with respect to the frame members.

         <p id="p-0037" num="0036">Illustrative embodiments are described below as they might be employed in a wall installation
            system. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are
            described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development
            of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be
            made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related
            and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another.
            Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and
            time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary
            skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.

         <p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further aspects and advantages of the various embodiments will become apparent from
            consideration of the following description and drawings. These embodiments are described
            in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention,
            and it is to be understood that modifications to the various disclosed embodiments
            can be made, and other embodiments can be utilized, without departing from the spirit
            and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore,
            not to be taken in a limiting sense.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0039" num="0038">Shown in figref[FIGS. 1A and 1B]
            	 is an aircraft sidewall panel 
            <b>10</b> that is ready to be installed in the interior of an aircraft. Aircraft sidewall panels
            are frequently honeycomb core or crush-core polymer panels, though other materials
            can also be used, such as aluminum, and it is to be understood that the system disclosed
            herein is not limited to these materials. Viewing figref[FIG. 1A]
            	, this sidewall panel embodiment includes a back surface 
            <b>14</b>, to which window frames 
            <b>16</b> are attached and positioned to align with exterior structural windows 
            <b>18</b> in the outer skin of the aircraft. The sidewall panel 
            <b>10</b> has a top edge 
            <b>20</b>, a bottom edge 
            <b>22</b>, a right edge 
            <b>24</b>, and a left edge 
            <b>26</b> (though these edges appear reversed in the rear view of figref[FIG. 1A]
            	). Adjacent sidewall panels 
            <b>28</b> are also visible in figref[FIG. 1B]
            	. The bottom edge 
            <b>22</b> of the wall panel and the bottom edges 
            <b>30</b> of the adjacent wall panels are intended to generally align along line 
            <b>32</b>, which can be parallel with what is called the water line of the aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the embodiment shown in figref[FIG. 1B]
            	, below the water line 
            <b>32</b> are a series of ventilation panels 
            <b>34</b>, which extend from the water line down to the aircraft cabin floor 
            <b>36</b>, and are part of the aircraft ventilation system. These lower panels are sometimes
            referred to as decompression air grills, and in one embodiment extend about 15″ above
            the floor. These can be installed after the respective sidewall panels above them
            are installed, as discussed in more detail below.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0041" num="0040">Extending from the back 
            <b>14</b> of the sidewall panel 
            <b>10</b> are a plurality of tabs 
            <b>38</b>. These tabs are configured to interlock with a spline structure 
            <b>40</b> that is attached to the frame 
            <b>12</b> as part of the wall installation system 
            <b>8</b> described herein.

         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">Shown in figref[FIG. 1B]
            	 is a perspective view of an embodiment of a sidewall installation system 
            <b>8</b>. This figure shows the aircraft interior sidewall panel 
            <b>10</b> positioned near an aircraft interior frame having multiple parallel frame members
            
            <b>12</b>. In this embodiment the frame members 
            <b>12</b> are generally upright, curved ribs of an aircraft fuselage, with a wall installation
            spline 
            <b>40</b> attached to at least some of the frame members. It is to be understood that the wall
            installation system 
            <b>8</b> and method disclosed herein can be used with frame members that are curved or straight,
            and with frame members that are vertical, horizontal, or at any other angle. Where
            the frame members 
            <b>12</b> are curved, the curvature of the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> can generally match the curvature of the frame members, though the system and method
            disclosed herein can apply to wall panels that are not curved. In an aircraft application,
            the frame members 
            <b>12</b> are likely to be of aluminum or composite material (e.g. reinforced carbon fiber).
            However the wall installation system 
            <b>8</b> disclosed herein is useful with frame members of many other materials, such as metal,
            polymer or composite, wood, etc.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0043" num="0042">Viewing figref[FIG. 2]
            	, some of the tabs 
            <b>38</b> are visible in more detail. The tabs can be of strong, resilient polymer material,
            such as Ultem® (polyetherimide) or PEEK (polyetheretherketone). Other materials can
            also be used. Visible in figref[FIGS. 1B and 2]
            	 is the wall installation spline 
            <b>40</b> that is attached to the frame members 
            <b>12</b>. The spline 
            <b>40</b> includes a plurality of insert slots 
            <b>48</b> for receiving the tabs 
            <b>38</b> of the wall panel 
            <b>10</b>, and a pull tab 
            <b>98</b> for locking the tabs to the spline and thus to the frame 
            <b>12</b>. A lower index retainer 
            <b>70</b> is also attached to the frame 
            <b>12</b> below the bottom end of the spline

         <p id="p-0044" num="0043">An exploded perspective view of this embodiment of a wall installation system 
            <b>8</b> is provided in figref[FIG. 3]
            	. The view of figref[FIG. 3]
            	 is looking down at the top 
            <b>45</b> of the channel 
            <b>56</b> and spline 
            <b>40</b>. In the embodiment shown in figref[FIGS. 2 and 3]
            	, the spline 
            <b>40</b> is a “T” section structural member having a web 
            <b>42</b> and a flange 
            <b>44</b>. The web of the spline is fixedly attachable to the frame member 
            <b>12</b>, such as via production shock mounts (not shown) located near the top end 
            <b>45</b> and bottom end (
            <b>47</b> in figref[FIGS. 5 and 6]
            	) of the spline 
            <b>40</b>, supporting the structural spline like a bridge. Shock mounts are well known in the
            aircraft industry, and those of skill in the art will be able to select and use suitable
            shock mounts to attach the spline 
            <b>40</b> to the aircraft frame member 
            <b>12</b>. In other embodiments, the spline 
            <b>40</b> can be attached to the frame 
            <b>12</b> at more than two connection locations. Different numbers of connectors can also be
            used. Using only two connectors helps to reduce the transmission of mechanical noise
            energy and vibration to the spline by virtue of having fewer mechanical connection
            points through which vibration can be transmitted, and also reduces weight (since
            there are fewer connectors), installation time, and the part count of the installation.
            Alternatively, more connectors can increase the strength of the connection. As with
            the tabs 
            <b>38</b>, the spline 
            <b>40</b> can be of polymer material, such as Ultem® or PEEK, or it can be of metal, such as
            aluminum.

            	, the interior face 
            <b>46</b> of the flange 
            <b>44</b> of the spline 
            <b>40</b> includes two series' of insert slots 
            <b>48</b> on opposing flanges 
            <b>44</b>, which correspond to positions of tabs 
            <b>38</b> on two adjacent wall panels 
            <b>10</b>, to allow passage of each tab 
            <b>38</b> into a respective locking slot, as discussed below. This allows two adjacent wall
            panels to attach to a single spline. The tabs 
            <b>38</b> are substantially rigid, upstanding members with a distal bulb end 
            <b>54</b> configured to engage the receiving portion of a locking slot in a friction or snap-in
            fit, as discussed below. The tabs 
            <b>38</b> generally include a base 
            <b>50</b>, which is attached to the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> (e.g. via adhesive or other attachment method), an upright stem 
            <b>52</b> that extends generally perpendicularly from the base 
            <b>50</b>, and a distal bulb portion 
            <b>54</b>, that is intended to pass through a respective insert slot 
            <b>48</b> and into a locking slot of a lock strip, as described below. A variety of configurations
            for the tabs 
            <b>38</b> have been considered and tested, and the wall installation system 
            <b>8</b> disclosed herein is not limited to the configuration shown in the drawings. For example,
            tabs having a bulb top 
            <b>54</b> with a gap or slot (not shown) for providing spring-like performance upon insertion
            have been tested. Other configurations can also be used.

            <b>56</b>. As shown most clearly in figref[FIGS. 10 and 11]
            	, the channel member

            <b>59</b>. The channel 
            <b>56</b> is configured to hold a lock strip

            <b>38</b> of the wall panel 
            <b>10</b>, as described in more detail below. The channel 
            <b>56</b> can be of metal (e.g. aluminum), composite material, or polymer material, such as
            Ultem® or PEEK. It is to be understood that figref[FIG. 3]
            	 is an exploded view, and shows the channel

            	. Alternatively, the channel 
            <b>56</b> can be integrally formed as part of the spline 
            <b>40</b>. An embodiment of a spline 
            <b>140</b> having an integrally formed channel 
            <b>156</b> is shown in figref[FIG. 5]
            	. As shown in the other spline embodiment described above, the spline 
            <b>140</b> is a “T” section structural member having a web 
            <b>142</b> and a pair of flanges 
            <b>144</b>
            <i>a, b</i>. The web 
            <b>142</b> of the spline is designed to be fixedly attached to the frame member 
            <b>12</b> of the aircraft, such as by production shock mounts, as discussed above. The back
            side of each flange 
            <b>144</b> includes an integral channel 
            <b>156</b> for carrying a lock strip, as discussed above. The central floor 
            <b>159</b> of the channel 
            <b>156</b> has side walls 
            <b>157</b> that are configured to wrap around and hold the edges of the lock strip 
            <b>58</b>, allowing it to linearly slide within the channel

            <b>38</b> of the wall panel 
            <b>10</b>, as described in more detail below. The interior face

            <b>144</b> of the spline 
            <b>140</b> includes a series of insert slots 
            <b>148</b> that correspond to positions of locking slots in the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> for each channel 
            <b>156</b>, to allow locking tabs 
            <b>38</b> from two adjacent wall panels 
            <b>10</b> to insert into the respective slots for locking, as discussed below. As with the
            other embodiment discussed above, the spline 
            <b>140</b> with the integral channel 
            <b>156</b> can be of polymer, metal, or other suitable materials.

         <p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to figref[FIG. 3]
            	, the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> has a plurality of three-position locking slots 
            <b>60</b>. Each locking slot 
            <b>60</b> is positioned to generally align with one of the insert slots 
            <b>48</b> of the spline, as discussed above. The locking slot 
            <b>60</b> has three different sections or portions that vary in width, and is configured to
            receive the tabs 
            <b>38</b> that are mounted on the back side of the sidewall panels. In one embodiment, the
            lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is of 4-6 ply fiberglass phenolic material, which is tough and resilient, and interlocks
            well with the polymer tabs 
            <b>38</b>. Other materials can also be used.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0049" num="0048">Various views of the channel 
            <b>56</b> and lock strip 
            <b>58</b> are shown in figref[FIGS. 10-14]
            	. The lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is linearly moveable in the channel 
            <b>56</b>, as indicated by double arrow 
            <b>61</b> in figref[FIGS. 6]
            	, 
            <b>7</b>B, 
            <b>9</b> and 
            <b>12</b>-
            <b>14</b>. Each locking slot 
            <b>60</b> includes a receiving portion 
            <b>62</b> which is the lowest portion of the locking slot 
            <b>60</b>, a locking portion 
            <b>64</b> in the middle, and a release portion 
            <b>66</b> at the upper end of the locking slot. The locking portion 
            <b>64</b> is the narrowest, while the release portion 
            <b>66</b> is the widest, and the receiving portion 
            <b>62</b> is between the two with respect to width.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0050" num="0049">The receiving portion 
            <b>62</b> is configured to receive the tab 
            <b>38</b> in a friction fit or “snap” fit. Both the tabs 
            <b>38</b> and the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> can be of resilient polymer material, which is somewhat flexible and pliable. Other
            materials can also be used. The receiving portion 
            <b>62</b> has a width that is slightly narrower than the distal bulb 
            <b>54</b> of the tab 
            <b>38</b>. This allows the distal bulb 
            <b>54</b> to be pushed into the receiving portion 
            <b>62</b> in a press fit that can hold the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> in rough position, before it is locked into place. This allows the position of the
            wall panel 
            <b>10</b> to be adjusted slightly after it is initially attached to the wall frame members
            
            <b>12</b>. The channel 
            <b>56</b> can be slightly wider than the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> (e.g. by about 0.125″), so that the lock strip not only slides up and down in the
            channel 
            <b>56</b>, but is also allowed to flow side to side a small amount within the central floor
            
            <b>59</b> of the channel. The amount of lateral play allowed between the side walls 
            <b>57</b> of the channel and the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> can be adjusted to provide more adjustability of the lock strip position, if desired.
            Consequently, slight up-down and fore-aft adjustment of the position of the tabs 
            <b>38</b> (and hence of the wall panel 
            <b>10</b>) is possible after the tab 
            <b>38</b> is inserted into the receiving portion 
            <b>62</b>. This allows the sidewall 
            <b>10</b> to be snapped in, holding it in place without being fully constrained, so that the
            sidewall 
            <b>10</b> can be adjusted to align with adjacent structure (e.g. window structure 
            <b>18</b> in figref[FIG. 1B]
            	, adjacent sidewall panels 
            <b>28</b> in figref[FIG. 1B]
            	, etc.). As described below, the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is then pulled down to a locked position (shown in figref[FIGS. 6]
            	, 
            <b>7</b>A-B and 
            <b>13</b>) once sidewall alignment has been achieved.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0051" num="0050">The press-fit configuration of the tabs 
            <b>38</b> and the receiving portion 
            <b>62</b> allows any of the tabs 
            <b>38</b> to be pulled back out of their respective receiving portions 
            <b>62</b> if desired, such as for repositioning of the wall panel, etc., without damaging the
            wall panel, tabs or splines 
            <b>40</b>. However, the tabs are more easily removed if the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is pulled to its release position, as shown in figref[FIG. 14]
            	 and described below. The size and configuration of the tabs 
            <b>38</b> and bulbs 
            <b>54</b> with respect to the receiving portions 
            <b>62</b> are selected to make insertion easy, but extraction not as easy. This helps prevent
            the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> from falling away from the frame 
            <b>12</b> after initial insertion of the tabs 
            <b>38</b>. This feature is provided in part by the configuration of the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> and the channel 
            <b>56</b>. When a tab 
            <b>38</b> is inserted into the receiving portion 
            <b>62</b>, the force pushing the tab can temporarily deform the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> away from the channel (since the lock strip is flexible), thus allowing the rounded
            distal surface of the bulb 
            <b>54</b> of the tab 
            <b>38</b> to deform the receiving portion 
            <b>62</b> and allow entrance of the tab. However, once the tab enters the receiving portion
            
            <b>62</b> and the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> has snapped back to its undeformed configuration, the back side of the bulb 
            <b>54</b> (which is not as rounded as the distal end of the bulb) is not as capable of deforming
            and pushing back through the receiving portion 
            <b>62</b>. Moreover, the lock strip is directly supported against force in the opposite direction
            by the floor 
            <b>59</b> of the channel 
            <b>56</b>, and by the spline 
            <b>40</b>. This dramatically reduces the degree of flexibility of the lock strip, 
            <b>58</b> making it more difficult to remove a tab 
            <b>38</b> from the receiving portion 
            <b>62</b> than it is to insert the tab in the first place.

            <b>20</b> of the panel 
            <b>10</b>, before snapping the tabs 
            <b>38</b> into the receiving portions

            <b>20</b> of a wall panel 
            <b>10</b>. The upper alignment device 
            <b>68</b> can be a separate channel device attached to the frame 
            <b>12</b>, or it can be, for example, a strong back of an overhead stowage bin 
            <b>67</b>, which can include an elongate slot 
            <b>69</b> that is configured to perform the same function. One upper alignment device 
            <b>68</b> can be shared to receive the top edges 
            <b>20</b> of two or more adjacent sidewall panels 
            <b>10</b>. Indeed, a substantially continuous upper alignment device 
            <b>68</b> can extend for a long distance between a row of overhead storage bins 
            <b>67</b> and the adjacent side frame structure 
            <b>12</b> of an aircraft, providing an alignment reference for a series of adjacent wall panels

            <b>62</b> of the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> does not merely perform a snap-in and snap-out function. Snap-in and snap-out devices
            can tend to break or become damaged with even limited usage, and the likelihood of
            damage increases depending on the strength of the fit. For an aircraft sidewall application,
            it is desirable that a snap-in and snap-out device have strength comparable to a traditional
            screw fastener. This is difficult to achieve without producing a configuration that
            is highly susceptible to damage.

         <p id="p-0054" num="0053">The snap-in attachment system disclosed herein provides easy engagement of the panel
            
            <b>10</b> to its mating part—the locking slot 
            <b>60</b>. Because the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is linearly slidable, the locking slot 
            <b>60</b> is not stationary, and moves when the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is pulled down (or pushed up, as discussed below) as indicated by arrow 
            <b>61</b>. When a worker begins installation of a wall panel 
            <b>10</b>, the worker can first get the top two tabs 
            <b>38</b> (e.g. one at upper left and one at upper right of the panel 
            <b>10</b>) to snap into their respective receiving portions 
            <b>62</b>. This becomes a primary installation index. This initial engagement will keep the
            sidewall panel loosely attached (i.e. hanging in place) on the spline 
            <b>40</b>, and thereby upon the frame members 
            <b>12</b>. The rest of the tabs 
            <b>38</b> can then be blind-pushed into their corresponding receiving portions 
            <b>62</b> without interference. In this way, all tabs 
            <b>38</b> of a given wall panel 
            <b>10</b> can be snapped into their respective locking slots 
            <b>60</b> and initially kept in place, before they are locked. In one embodiment, there are
            eight snap-in tabs 
            <b>38</b> per sidewall panel 
            <b>10</b>, though other numbers of tabs can be used. Under non-locking status, the sidewall
            panel 
            <b>10</b> is allowed to have a level of adjustment for window alignment. With all attachments
            set, adjusting window alignment or other alignment aspects of the panel is greatly
            simplified.

            <b>68</b> during installation, the top edge 
            <b>20</b> of the panel will be caught in place, and stopped from further advancement or moving
            upward. This guides the installer to place the sidewall 
            <b>10</b> in an appropriate position before the next step. At this point, the sidewall 
            <b>10</b> can be moved or adjusted, as desired, to find access for the top left and right tabs
            
            <b>38</b> to snap into their receiving portions 
            <b>62</b>, as discussed above. Once engaged, the upper alignment device

         <p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first type of lower index retainer 
            <b>70</b>, shown in figref[FIG. 6]
            	, includes a retainer clip 
            <b>72</b>, which is attached to the air frame 
            <b>12</b>, such as via a production shock mount. A snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b> is attached to the wall panel 
            <b>10</b>. As shown in figref[FIG. 1A]
            	, an individual wall panel 
            <b>10</b> can have two snap-in wedges attached near the bottom edge 
            <b>22</b>. The lock strip 
            <b>58</b>, channel 
            <b>56</b> and spline 
            <b>40</b> of the wall attachment system 
            <b>8</b> are also visible in the view of figref[FIG. 6]
            	. The lower index retainer assembly 
            <b>70</b> is a passive, one-piece retainer device that is configured to capture the snap-in
            wedge 
            <b>76</b> from the lower region of the sidewall panel 
            <b>10</b>. In this assembly, the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> includes a vertical slot 
            <b>78</b> that allows the snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b> to pass through the lock strip to reach the retainer clip 
            <b>72</b>. A close-up view of one embodiment of a snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b> is shown in figref[FIG. 8A]
            	. The snap in wedge 
            <b>76</b> generally includes a pointed distal end 
            <b>77</b>, a bottom edge 
            <b>79</b>, and an upper slot 
            <b>74</b>. Viewing figref[FIG. 6]
            	, the retainer clip 
            <b>72</b> includes a resilient upper clip member 
            <b>73</b>, which snaps into the upper slot 
            <b>74</b> of the wedge 
            <b>76</b> when the wedge is inserted into the clip. The clip 
            <b>72</b> also includes a lower support shelf 
            <b>75</b>, which supports the bottom 
            <b>79</b> of the wedge 
            <b>76</b>, thereby supporting the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> when the wedge is inserted.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the wedge 
            <b>76</b> is inserted into the clip 
            <b>72</b>, vertical, fore and aft and other adjustments of the wall panel are still possible,
            though the panel 
            <b>10</b> is supported substantially at the waterline level 
            <b>32</b>. As with the tabs 
            <b>38</b>, discussed above, once the wedge 
            <b>76</b> is initially engaged in the retainer clip 
            <b>72</b>, but before pulling the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> to lock the system, the sidewall 
            <b>10</b> is not completely constrained. It is allowed to move around within slightly to allow
            window alignment. With this type of lower index retainer 
            <b>70</b>, removing the wedge 
            <b>76</b> from the retainer clip 
            <b>72</b> simply requires pulling on the bottom 
            <b>22</b> of the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> to withdraw the wedge 
            <b>76</b> from the clip 
            <b>72</b>, after the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is released, as discussed below.

         <p id="p-0059" num="0058">A second type of lower index retainer assembly 
            <b>80</b> is shown in figref[FIGS. 7A and 7B]
            	. It is to be understood that the lower index retainer configurations of either figref[FIG. 6]
            	 or figref[FIGS. 7A-B]
            	 can be used with the wall panel attachment system 
            <b>8</b> shown and described herein. Other configurations can also be used. The embodiment
            shown in figref[FIGS. 7A and 7B]
            	 includes an index retainer body 
            <b>82</b> that is designed to be attached to the airframe 
            <b>12</b> below the bottom edge of the spline (
            <b>40</b> in figref[FIG. 6]
            	), at a similar position and orientation as the lower index retainer embodiment 
            <b>72</b> shown in figref[FIG. 6]
            	 and discussed above. The index retainer body 
            <b>82</b> includes a forward slot for receiving the snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b>, an upper clip member 
            <b>83</b> that interlocks with the wedge 
            <b>76</b>, in the manner discussed above, and a spring-loaded slide block 
            <b>84</b> disposed below the snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b>. As with the configuration shown in figref[FIG. 6]
            	 and discussed above, in the embodiment of figref[FIGS. 7A and 7B]
            	 the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> includes a slot 
            <b>78</b> for allowing passage of the wedge 
            <b>76</b>, and also includes a slot frame 
            <b>85</b> having slot edge bumpers 
            <b>86</b> that extend outward from the slot frame 
            <b>85</b>. A close-up view of these bumpers is shown in figref[FIG. 7B]
            	. The bumpers 
            <b>86</b> are positioned alongside the central extent of the slot 
            <b>78</b>, and are designed to contact the top surface of the slide block 
            <b>84</b> when the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is at the locking position. This stops the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> from moving further down, keeping it at full locking position, but without going
            beyond that position.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0060" num="0059">The snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b> and the slot edge bumpers 
            <b>86</b> can also be configured to provide additional interlocking structure to hold the wall
            panel in place. As shown in figref[FIG. 7A]
            	, the body of the snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b> can include vertical ridges 
            <b>81</b>. While only one side of the snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b> is shown in figref[FIG. 7A]
            	, similar ridges can be provided on the opposite side, also. These ridges 
            <b>81</b> can be configured to interlock with similar vertical ridges 
            <b>83</b> that are provided on the interior faces of the lock strip slot edge frame bumpers
            
            <b>86</b>, as shown in figref[FIG. 7B]
            	. When the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is pulled down to the locking position, as shown in figref[FIG. 7A]
            	, the ridges 
            <b>83</b> on the inside of the bumpers 
            <b>86</b> will intermesh with the ridges 
            <b>81</b> on the outside of the snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b>, thus providing additional locking force to hold the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> in place. The snap-in wedges 
            <b>76</b> and bumpers 
            <b>86</b>, with the ridges 
            <b>81</b> and 
            <b>83</b>, can thus be viewed as a slightly different and larger version of the interlocking
            tabs 
            <b>38</b> and their associated locking structure. These elements provide structure that completes
            the fastening of the lower portion of the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> to the spline 
            <b>40</b> and thus to the frame 
            <b>12</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0061" num="0060">The slide block 
            <b>84</b> also includes a downwardly extending release tab 
            <b>87</b> at its rear extremity, and a sloped surface 
            <b>88</b> on the underside of its forward end. The release tab 
            <b>87</b> is used to push the slide block back, away from the lock strip 
            <b>58</b>, thereby withdrawing the forward portion of the slide block from contacting the bumpers
            
            <b>86</b>, thereby allowing the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> to be drawn downward for releasing the wall panel 
            <b>10</b>, in the manner discussed below. The backwardly extended position of the slide block
            
            <b>84</b> is shown in dashed lines at 
            <b>89</b> in figref[FIG. 7B]
            	. Biasing of the slide block toward the forward locking position can be accomplished
            with a spring element 
            <b>90</b>, which can be metal, polymer or other suitable material, and can be configured in
            various ways. The sloped bottom surface 
            <b>88</b> of the slide block 
            <b>84</b> provides a wedge surface to allow the bumper 
            <b>86</b> to push the slide block aside (against the biasing force upon the slide block) when
            the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is pushed upwardly, similar to the way a door latch is naturally pushed aside when
            the angled and/or curved latch face contacts a strike plate when a door is closed.

         <p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in figref[FIG. 7B]
            	, the length of the slot 
            <b>78</b> allows the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> to be in an upper position, shown in dashed lines at 
            <b>92</b>, when the snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b> is first inserted. This position can correspond to the alignment of the receiving
            portions 
            <b>62</b> with the spline insert slots 
            <b>48</b> for initial insertion of the tabs 
            <b>38</b> (see figref[FIG. 12]
            	). The lock strip 
            <b>58</b> will be in the position shown in figref[FIG. 7B]
            	 when the lock strip is pulled downward to the locking position, which can correspond
            to the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> having the locking portion 
            <b>64</b> aligned with the tabs 
            <b>38</b> to lock the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> in place (see figref[FIG. 13]
            	).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0063" num="0062">Finally, the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> can be pulled to the fully down release position, shown at 
            <b>93</b> in figref[FIG. 7B]
            	, after the slide block 
            <b>84</b> is withdrawn, to align the release portion 
            <b>66</b> with the spline insert slot 
            <b>48</b> and allow removal of the tabs 
            <b>38</b> and the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> (see figref[FIG. 14]
            	). Contact of the top inside surface of the slot 
            <b>78</b> with the top edge of the snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b> can serve to define the maximum downward extent of travel of the lock strip. In this
            way, the lower index retainer 
            <b>80</b> and the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> with the slot frame 
            <b>85</b> and bumpers 
            <b>86</b> create a mechanical stop for the locking position of the lock strip through contact
            of the bumpers 
            <b>86</b> with the slide block 
            <b>84</b>, and the extent of the slot

         </p>
         <p id="p-0064" num="0063">It will be apparent that there is no structure shown in figref[FIGS. 7A and 7B]
            	 that governs or restricts the upper position (shown at 
            <b>92</b> in figref[FIG. 7B]
            	) of the lower lock strip slot 
            <b>78</b> when there is no snap-in wedge 
            <b>76</b> inserted through that slot and received in the lower index retainer 
            <b>80</b>. As shown in figref[FIG. 9]
            	, which shows the top end 
            <b>45</b> of the channel 
            <b>56</b>, this upper position can be governed by a reset stop 
            <b>94</b> positioned at the top of the lock strip channel 
            <b>56</b>. The reset stop 
            <b>94</b> in this embodiment includes an end wall 
            <b>95</b> and a stop tab 
            <b>96</b> that is biased downward to contact or nearly contact (e.g. 0.03″ above) the floor
            
            <b>59</b> of the channel 
            <b>56</b>. The stop tab

            <b>99</b> on the upper end of the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> when it is pushed to this upper position. After the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> has been pulled down to the release position and the panel 
            <b>10</b> removed, the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> can then be pushed fully upward to the reset position, at which point the top edge
            of lock strip 
            <b>58</b> will bump against face 
            <b>95</b> and stop. During this upward movement, the ridge 
            <b>99</b> of the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> will contact the tab face 
            <b>97</b> and push the stop tab 
            <b>96</b> upward, allowing the ridge 
            <b>99</b> to pass under and beyond the tab and then be held in place by the tab 
            <b>96</b> as it springs back to its biased position, as shown in figref[FIG. 9]
            	. In this position the receiving portions

            the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is slightly narrower than the channel 
            <b>56</b>, as discussed above, and because the entry opening of the lower index retainer (

         <p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to figref[FIGS. 10-14]

            the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> is held in place while the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> is drawn down within the channel

            <b>60</b> draws down around the tab 
            <b>38</b> to lock the tab (and hence the wall panel 
            <b>10</b>) with respect to the frame member

         <p id="p-0068" num="0067">It will be apparent that with the wall panel

            the region below the bottom edges

            <b>64</b> is apparent by viewing figref[FIGS. 12 and 13]

            	, the locking portion 
            <b>64</b> includes side walls 
            <b>100</b>, which draw laterally close together, like a pair of wedges, in order to bear against
            opposing sides of the stem portion 
            <b>52</b> of the tab 
            <b>38</b>. This helps to positionally lock the tab with respect to the frame member 
            <b>12</b> in the lateral direction (lateral relative to the orientation of the tab 
            <b>38</b>, fore and aft with respect to the aircraft). The locking portion 
            <b>64</b> also includes a pair of uprising rims 
            <b>102</b> on opposing sides of the locking slot 
            <b>60</b>, which bear against the underside of the distal bulb portion 
            <b>54</b> of the tab, and thus provide wedge action that applies axial tension on the tab 
            <b>38</b>, tending to pull it further through the insert slot 
            <b>48</b>, thus drawing the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> snugly against the spline 
            <b>40</b> and positionally locking the tab 
            <b>38</b> and the wall panel 
            <b>10</b> to the spline 
            <b>40</b> and thus to the frame member

            <b>87</b> of the lower index retainer 
            <b>80</b> to withdraw the slide block 
            <b>84</b> from below the bumpers

            <b>66</b>, the tab 
            <b>38</b> merely rests loosely in the release portion, allowing the wall panel

         <p id="p-0080" num="0079">Apparatus and methods embodied herein may be employed during any one or more of the
            stages of the sidewall installation method 
            <b>200</b>. For example, components or subassemblies corresponding to method 
            <b>200</b> may be fabricated or manufactured in a manner similar to components or subassemblies
            produced while the aircraft 
            <b>202</b> is in service. Also, one or more apparatus embodiments, method embodiments, or a
            combination thereof may be utilized during production, for example, by substantially
            expediting assembly of or reducing the cost of an aircraft 
            <b>202</b>. Similarly, one or more of apparatus embodiments, method embodiments, or a combination
            thereof may be utilized while the aircraft 
            <b>202</b> is in service, for example and without limitation, during maintenance and service.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0081" num="0080">The system and method disclosed herein addresses aircraft sidewall installation and
            positioning issues using a snap-in attachment approach that does not involve screws
            or tooling during installation. This wall panel attachment system 
            <b>8</b> provides a simple, snap-in design, which allows sidewall panels 
            <b>10</b> to push in and snap, keeping the sidewall panel in place without initially being
            locked. Before final locking of the sidewall panels, the worker can make appropriate
            adjustments for window alignment, etc. To lock the panels in place, the worker pulls
            the lock strip 
            <b>58</b> down to lock at once all attaching devices that are associated with a single lock
            strip, without the need for additional hardware or tooling. Once the panels are locked
            in place, their position is securely fixed without the need for screws, washers, other
            fasteners.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0082" num="0081">Advantageously, installation and removal of these wall panels 
            <b>10</b> can be accomplished by a single worker, without additional parts, fasteners or tooling.
            The installation and removal process is also very quick. It has been found that installation
            or removal of a sidewall according to this design can be routinely accomplished in
            half a minute or less. More specifically, it has been found that installation of a
            sidewall panel can be accomplished in about 
            <b>20</b> seconds or less by a single worker without significant risk or expectation of system
            deformation or gaps. The steps of attaching or removing a wall panel have each been
            found to take about 
            <b>10</b> seconds or less using this system. When attaching the wall panel, alignment with
            adjacent panels and adjustment and centering of the sidewall to a structural window
            can add another 
            <b>10</b> seconds to the process.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0083" num="0082">This system and method thus offers a simple and secure sidewall installation. In one
            embodiment it reduces the number of structural attachments to the airframe from eight
            to three, and reduces the use of shock-mount brackets and related spacers. It can
            help speed sidewall installation and improve aircraft production rates during manufacture.
            It also saves time and expense for aircraft users by reducing the time and labor that
            is typically involved in regular airplane mandatory checks and maintenance procedures
            that involve sidewall removal, and helps reduce damage and wear to panels that can
            often result from removal and reinstallation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0084" num="0083">It should also be appreciated that the wall panel installation system 
            <b>8</b> disclosed herein is not limited to use in aircraft. For example, a wall panel installation
            system and method as disclosed herein can be used for room dividers, where removable
            panels are desired. This system and method could also be used for automotive interiors
            and cabinetry, for example, where it is desirable to hide equipment behind a panel,
            and yet be able to remove the panel for maintenance, if desired. Those of skill in
            the art will recognize that other applications are also possible.
