         <h1>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The instant application is a national phase of, and claims priority to, PCT International
            Application No. PCT/GB2010/050759, filed on May 10, 2010, pending, and GB Patent Application
            Serial No. 0907951.8, filed on May 8, 2009, pending, the entire specifications of
            both of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to window installations for inclined roofs, in particular
            to a mounting bracket suitable for mounting such a roof window to a roof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Roof windows, or skylights, which are fitted to sloping or inclined roof surfaces
            typically compromise a main frame structure and a openable sash structure, each having
            top, bottom and side members, the main frame being mountable to the roof structural
            members and the sash being pivotally mounted to the main frame about an axis of rotation
            parallel with the respective top and bottom members. During installation care must
            be taken to ensure that the roof window is mounted to the roof at a correct height
            above the surrounding roof surface in order to accommodate the particular roof covering
            used or to be used, the various possible roof covering materials often varying widely
            in thickness and type.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Presently, fixtures are provided as separate items which must be attached to the window
            assembly by the persons installing the windows and often there can be confusion as
            to their correct usage in terms of setting the correct height of the window as well
            as overall positioning and alignment. As a result correct installation of a roof window
            can be a time consuming activity that is fraught with potential error and is unsuitable
            for unskilled workers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an object of the present invention to alleviate the disadvantages
            associated with the prior art.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present invention provides a mounting bracket for a roof window comprising
            frame mountable means, roof mountable means and hinge means for mechanically coupling
            the roof mountable means and the frame mountable means together so that the roof mountable
            means is movable between an out of use storage position and an in use mounting position,
            wherein the location of the pivotal point of the hinge means is movable/adjustable.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Advantageously, the roof mountable means can be moved pivotally relative to the frame
            mountable means and therefore pivotally relative to the frame when the mounting bracket
            is mounted on the window frame. This means that the mounting bracket can be stowed
            substantially within the boundary of the frame during transport and hinged into the
            mounting position for installation. However, the design of the mounting bracket to
            facilitate movement of the pivotal point of the hinge means also allows the roof mountable
            means to be adjustable relative to the frame mountable means and consequently the
            window frame in a plane substantially parallel to a vertical surface of the window
            frame in use.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Ideally, the hinge means has guide means and slide means. Advantageously, the guide
            means and the slide means allows the position of the pivotal point of the hinge means
            to be easily moved in a controlled manner. This slide means and guide means also helps
            to ensure the adjustability of the mounting bracket between the out of use storage
            position and the in use mounting position is intuitive for the person installing the
            roof window.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the location of the slide means is adjustable along the guide means.</p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">Ideally, the mounting bracket has means for releasably fixing the location of the
            roof mountable means relative to the frame mountable means at one or more in use mounting
            positions. Advantageously, the releasable fixing means allows the installer to select
            the appropriate position for the roof mountable means to be fixed relative to the
            frame mounting means. A number of options are engineered into the mounting bracket
            based on a number of different types of roof covering materials with a different depth
            dimension. The off site prefixing of the position of the in use bracket mounting positions
            means that the installer has no measuring, awkward holding or additional screwing
            to do in situ on the roof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the guide means comprises a pair of spaced apart mutually opposing slots.</p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">Ideally, the slide means comprises a pair of lugs for slidable engagement in the slots.
            Advantageously, the lugs and slots provide a simple mechanical engineering solution
            to allow the pivotal point of the hinge means to be adjusted along a preset track.
            This allows the roof mountable means to be intuitively adjusted between the out of
            use storage position and a range of in use mounting positions.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">Ideally, the spaced apart slots are formed on the roof mountable means or the frame
            mountable means. Advantageously, the slots are prefabricated and preferably pressed
            into either component of the mounting bracket during the manufacturing process.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the pair of lugs extend from the roof mountable means or the frame mountable
            means. Advantageously, the lugs are prefabricated into either component of the mounting
            bracket during the manufacturing process.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">Ideally, the spaced apart slots are rectilinear or curvilinear. Advantageously, the
            curvilinear slots accommodate the roof mountable means to be stowed in an out of use
            position on an adjacent frame member of the roof window frame.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the guide means comprises a guide pin and the slide means comprises a
            collar.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">Ideally, the releasable fixing means comprises male and female members provided between
            the roof mountable means and the frame mountable means. Advantageously, the male and
            female releasable fixing members pre engineered into the mounting bracket accommodate
            quick and safe locating of the roof mountable means in one of a range of in use mounting
            positions subject to the specific roofing materials to be used.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the releasable fixing means comprises one or more tongues for interaction
            with one or more grooves.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">Ideally, the releasable fixing means comprises visible indicia means where the mounting
            bracket has two or more in use mounting positions. Advantageously, the roof window
            installation instructions will advise which visible indicia means corresponds to which
            roof covering material. Again, the technical advantage achieved is that the fitter
            installing the roof window does not have to measure the position each bracket should
            be set at for a particular roof covering material. The installer simply selects one
            of the prefixed positions as indicated on the installation instructions and clicks
            the mounting bracket into place.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the visible indicia means comprises colour coded plugs formed for insertion
            into grooves. Advantageously, the installer is required to make a positive decision
            and action to remove a colour coded plug dependent on the roof covering material being
            installed on the roof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">Ideally, urging means are provided for urging the roof mountable means into either
            or both of the out of use storage position and the in use mounting position. Advantageously,
            the urging means removes the requirement for the roof mountable means to be temporarily
            fixed onto the frame in the storage position and also removes the requirement for
            temporary pinning means to hold the roof mountable means in the in use position. The
            urging means provides the mounting bracket with inbuilt flick fit technology giving
            the installer reassuring sensory feedback indicating a secure and accurate fitting
            of the mounting bracket.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the urging means is provided by biasing means or magnetic means.</p>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">Ideally, the biasing means is a leaf spring acting on a portion of the roof mountable
            means.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, the present invention also provides a roof window with a plurality of
            mounting brackets as outlined above.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, the present invention also provides a mounting bracket for a roof window
            comprising frame mountable means, roof mountable means and means for mechanically
            coupling the roof mountable means and the frame mountable means together so that the
            roof mountable means is movable between an out of use storage position and an in use
            mounting position and urging means for urging the roof mountable means into either
            or both of the out of use storage position and the in use mounting position. The advantages
            of the features highlighted above apply equally to the same features recited below
            in relation to this aspect of the invention.

         <p id="p-0044" num="0043">Conveniently, the roof mountable means is further adapted for attachment to a roof
            member such as a rafter or a lathe extending between adjacent rafters.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0045" num="0044">Advantageously, the roof mountable means is removably attachable to the frame mountable
            means.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0046" num="0045">Alternatively, the roof mountable means can be attached to the frame mountable means
            by hooks, catches, claps, screws, bolts or other suitable means.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0047" num="0046">Ideally, the frame mountable means is at least one mounting plate.</p>
         <p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably, the at least one mounting plate has at least one protruding tongue.</p>
         <p id="p-0049" num="0048">Alternatively, the frame mountable means is in the form of any one or more of, or
            combination of, the following: rail(s); recess(es); insert(s); pre-located or pre-drilled
            hole(s); pre-located screw(s); pre-located bolt(s); pre-located dowel(s); pre-machined
            locating slot(s). It should be appreciated that this is not exhaustive and that other
            suitable means can be used.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0050" num="0049">Conveniently, the at least one mounting plate is provided with one or more locating
            tabs.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0051" num="0050">Ideally, the one or more locating tabs project perpendicularly from one edge of the
            mounting plate to ensure accurate alignment of said mounting plate along the edge
            of a window frame member against which the tab or tabs engage.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferably, the roof mountable means comprises a substantially L-shaped bracket member
            having a first leg and a second leg.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0053" num="0052">Ideally, the first leg is coupled to the hinge means.</p>
         <p id="p-0054" num="0053">Preferably, the first leg has one or more grooves mountable onto the one or more tongues
            of the mounting plate.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0055" num="0054">Ideally, the second leg has means for coupling the L-shaped bracket member to the
            roof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a first embodiment, the first leg is adapted to reside substantially within a space
            defined by a cut-out portion on the mounting plate when the second leg is attached
            to the roof structure.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, on opposing side edges of the first leg there are provided opposing first
            and second pairs of lugs which extend laterally outwardly from said leg.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0058" num="0057">Conveniently, the first pair of lugs are adapted for slidable and pivotal cooperation
            with guide members provided on the mounting plate so that the L-shaped bracket can
            be moved laterally relative said mounting plate and can be pivoted relative said mounting
            plate.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0059" num="0058">Conveniently, the guide members provided on the mounting plate also provide the hinge
            means by which the L-shaped bracket is attached to the mounting plate.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0060" num="0059">Advantageously, the second pair of lugs function as stops which dwell within pairs
            of spaced part complementary recesses provided on the mounting plate when a desired
            mounting position is selected.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0061" num="0060">Advantageously, the complementary recesses provided on the mounting plate define predetermined
            first and second detent positions for the L-shaped bracket to observe, each detent
            position dependent upon the thickness of the type of roof covering the be used e.g.
            slate or tile, and which in turn determines the height of the window frame with respect
            to the surrounding roof surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0062" num="0061">Optionally, the mounting plate may be provided with additional complementary recesses
            so that additional predetermined detent positions for the L-shaped bracket to observe
            are provided thereby enabling a greater degree of mounting bracket adjustability.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0063" num="0062">Conveniently, the mounting plate is further provided with an elongate tab which extends
            at least partially over the cut-out portion of said mounting plate and which contacts
            the upper surface of the first leg in an overlapping manner when the mounting bracket
            is in an in-use position.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0064" num="0063">Advantageously, the tab provides additional rigidity to the mounting bracket and prevents
            the L-shaped bracket from rotatably moving or flexing relative the mounting plate
            when the mounting bracket is fastened to a window frame member and a roof member.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0065" num="0064">Advantageously, the L-shaped bracket can be pivoted backwardly over the mounting plate
            so that a roof window assembly incorporating the mounting brackets of the invention
            can be pre-packaged and delivered on-site with said mounting brackets already mounted
            in position and the L-shaped brackets conveniently stowed away without protruding
            outwardly from the window assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a second embodiment of the invention, the mounting plate is mountable over a groove
            or channel provided on the window frame member, the channel being provided with an
            urging means such as a spring which is insertable therein and which is engageable
            with the first leg of the L-shaped bracket when the mounting bracket is mounted to
            the window frame member. It will of course be appreciated that the groove or channel
            is one way of providing sufficient space for the urging means to function and is not
            an essential feature for the mounting bracket with an urging means to function properly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the second embodiment of the invention, the spring means is a leaf spring.</p>
         <p id="p-0068" num="0067">Advantageously, the spring bias of the leaf spring acting upon the L-shaped bracket
            enables said bracket to be movable between, and maintainable at any oone of or any
            combination of, a stowed position, an intermediate equilibrium position and an in
            use mounting position.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the second embodiment of the invention, the mounting plate is provided with a tongue
            which is engageable with one of a plurality of complementary grooves provided in the
            first leg of the L-shaped bracket.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0070" num="0069">Advantageously, the tongue acts as a stop when the bracket is moved into an in use

         <p id="p-0093" num="0092">Beneficially, the use of the of the various embodiments as described above enables
            reliable fitment of a window to a roof structure with excellent accuracy and reproducibility.
            In this way, a roof window to which the mounting brackets 
            <b>1</b>, 
            <b>41</b> are attached can be readily accommodated in a roof irrespective of the type of roof

         <p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to the drawings and now to figref[FIGS. 6 to 8]
            	, there is shown a third embodiment of mounting bracket indicated generally by the
            reference numeral 
            <b>91</b>. The mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> for a roof window 
            <b>92</b> has a frame mountable member 
            <b>93</b>, a roof mountable member 
            <b>94</b> and a hinge arrangement 
            <b>95</b> for mechanically coupling the roof mountable member 
            <b>94</b> and the frame mountable member 
            <b>93</b> together so that the roof mountable member 
            <b>94</b> is movable between an out of use storage position see figref[FIG. 6]
            	 and an in use mounting position, see figref[FIG. 8]
            	. The location of the pivotal axis of the hinge assembly 
            <b>95</b> is movable/adjustable.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0095" num="0094">Advantageously, the roof mountable member 
            <b>94</b> can be moved pivotally relative to the frame mountable member 
            <b>93</b> and therefore pivotally relative to the roof window frame 
            <b>92</b> when the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> is mounted on the roof window frame 
            <b>92</b>. This means that the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> can be stowed substantially within the boundary of the roof window frame 
            <b>92</b> during transport and subsequently hinged into the mounting position for installation.
            However, the design of the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> to facilitate movement of the pivotal axis of the hinge assembly 
            <b>95</b> also allows the roof mountable member 
            <b>94</b> to be adjustable relative to the frame mountable member 
            <b>93</b> and consequently the roof window frame 
            <b>92</b> in a plane substantially parallel to a vertical surface 
            <b>90</b> of the roof window frame 
            <b>92</b> in use.

         <p id="p-0096" num="0095">The hinge assembly 
            <b>95</b> has a guide arrangement 
            <b>97</b> and a slide arrangement 
            <b>98</b>. Advantageously, the guide arrangement 
            <b>97</b> and the slide arrangement 
            <b>98</b> ensure that the adjustability of the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> between the out of use storage position and the in use mounting position is intuitive
            for the person installing the roof window frame 
            <b>92</b>. The position of the slide arrangement 
            <b>98</b> is slidably adjustable along the guide arrangement 
            <b>97</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0097" num="0096">The mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> also has a male member 
            <b>101</b> and two cooperating female members 
            <b>102</b> for releasably fixing the location of the roof mountable member 
            <b>94</b> relative to the frame mountable member 
            <b>93</b> at two in use mounting positions. It will of course be appreciated that additional
            in use mounting positions can be added by simply adding additional female members
            
            <b>102</b>. Advantageously, the releasable fixing arrangement 
            <b>101</b>, 
            <b>102</b> allows the installer to select the appropriate position for the roof mountable member
            
            <b>94</b> to be fixed relative to the frame mounting member 
            <b>93</b>. A number of predetermined positions are engineered into the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> based on a number of different types of roof covering materials with a different
            depth dimension. The off-site prefixing of the position of the in use bracket mounting
            positions means that the installer has no measuring, awkward holding or additional
            screwing to do in situ on the roof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0098" num="0097">The guide arrangement 
            <b>97</b> comprises a pair of spaced apart mutually opposing elongate slots 
            <b>105</b> and the slide arrangement

            <b>116</b> for slidable engagement in the slots 
            <b>105</b>. Advantageously, the lugs 
            <b>116</b> and slots 
            <b>105</b> provide a simple mechanical engineering solution to allow the pivotal axis of the
            hinge assembly 
            <b>95</b> to be adjusted along a preset track. This allows the roof mountable member 
            <b>94</b> to be adjusted between the out of use storage position and a range of in use mounting
            positions. The spaced apart slots 
            <b>105</b> are formed on the frame mountable member 
            <b>93</b>. Advantageously, the slots 
            <b>105</b> are prefabricated into the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> during the manufacturing process. The slots 
            <b>105</b> are pressed. The pair of lugs 
            <b>116</b> extend from the roof mountable member 
            <b>94</b>. Advantageously, the lugs 
            <b>116</b> are also prefabricated into the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> during the manufacturing process. The spaced apart slots 
            <b>105</b> are curvilinear defining a 90 degree bend section along which the lugs 
            <b>116</b> extend. The roof mountable member 
            <b>94</b> is an L-shaped bracket and in combination with the curvilinear slots 
            <b>105</b>, these features allow the L-shaped bracket 
            <b>94</b> to be stowed in an out of use position on an adjacent frame member 
            <b>107</b> to the frame member the mounting plate 
            <b>93</b> is mounted on.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0099" num="0098">The male member 
            <b>101</b> in the form of a punched tongue with an upturned lip is provided on the frame mountable
            member 
            <b>93</b> and the female members 
            <b>102</b> are provided on a first leg of the L-shaped bracket 
            <b>94</b> in the form of two grooves. Advantageously, the male and female releasable fixing
            members 
            <b>101</b>, 
            <b>102</b> are engineered into the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> to accommodate quick and safe location of the roof mountable member 
            <b>94</b> in one of two in use mounting positions subject to the specific roofing materials
            to be used. The grooves 
            <b>102</b> in the first leg of the L shaped bracket 
            <b>94</b> are brought into alignment with the tongue 
            <b>101</b> on the frame mounted plate member 
            <b>93</b> by their relative positioning on their respective components in combination with
            the positioning of the guide members 
            <b>97</b> and slide members 
            <b>98</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0100" num="0099">The grooves 
            <b>102</b> are formed for receiving visible indicia members where the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> has two or more in use mounting positions. Advantageously, the roof window installation
            instructions will advise which visible indicia member corresponds to which roof covering
            material. Again, the technical advantage achieved is that the fitter installing the
            roof window does not have to measure the position each mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> should be set at for a particular roof covering material. The installer simply selects
            one of the prefixed positions as indicated on the installation instructions and clicks
            the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> into place. The visible indicia members are colour coded plugs formed for insertion
            into the grooves 
            <b>102</b>. Advantageously, the installer is required to make a positive decision and action
            to remove a colour coded plug dependent on the roof covering material being installed
            on the roof.

            <b>94</b> into either or both of the out of use storage position and the in use mounting position.
            Advantageously, the urging member 
            <b>114</b> removes the requirement for the L-shaped bracket 
            <b>94</b> to be temporarily fixed onto the roof window frame 
            <b>92</b> in the storage position and also removes the requirement for temporary pinning fixtures
            to hold the L-shaped bracket 
            <b>94</b> in the in use position. The urging member 
            <b>114</b> provides the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b> with inbuilt flick fit technology giving the installer reassuring sensory feedback
            indicating a secure and accurate fitting of the mounting bracket 
            <b>91</b>. The urging member 
            <b>114</b> is provided by a biasing member such as a spring or a magnet or both.

         <p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to the drawings and now to figref[FIGS. 9 to 11]
            	, there is shown a fourth embodiment of mounting bracket indicated generally by the
            reference numeral 
            <b>121</b>. The mounting bracket 
            <b>121</b> for a roof window 
            <b>122</b> has a frame mountable member 
            <b>123</b>, a roof mountable member 
            <b>124</b> and a hinge arrangement

            <b>121</b> is mounted on the roof window frame 
            <b>122</b>. This means that the mounting bracket 
            <b>121</b> can be stowed substantially within the boundary of the roof window frame 
            <b>122</b> during transport and subsequently hinged into the mounting position for installation.
            However, the design of the mounting bracket 
            <b>121</b> to facilitate movement of the pivotal point of the hinge assembly 
            <b>125</b> also allows the roof mountable member 
            <b>124</b> to be adjustable relative to the frame mountable member 
            <b>123</b> and consequently the roof window frame
