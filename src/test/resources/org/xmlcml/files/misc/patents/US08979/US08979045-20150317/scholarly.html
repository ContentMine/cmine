      <p>A railing mounting system for use on decks, balconies, fences or patios to provide
         additional surface space. In addition, the frame can be used to contain plantings,
         herb gardens, coolers, grills or other outdoor items. The mounting system is quickly
         and easily installed for use and just as easily removed and stored for subsequent
         use.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to a railing extension device for supporting
            various articles, and more specifically to a device that mounts to a railing and can
            support various items, including but not limited to a beverage cooler, trash can,
            a cooler, an electric grill, a glass surface for containing serving dishes and glasses,
            plants and/or an herb garden.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Decks, balconies and patios are prevalent in homes and restaurants and often contain
            a railing system of sorts to assist in providing a safety measure and barrier for
            occupants as decks, balconies and patios are often above ground level and/or may be
            near hazards such as water. Most decks, balconies and patios contain tables and chairs
            in order to provide places for people to eat and put their beverage glasses. The addition
            of tables and chairs often limits the amount of space available for people to stand
            and/or walk around on. Due to this, occupants often place plates and glasses on railings.
            These can easily be knocked off or slide off as the surface of the railing is not
            even due to warping or in the case of balconies the railing may only be one inch wide
            and therefore not useable for holding items.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">To meet the problem of providing additional surface space for decks and patios, a
            frame and strap system has been developed which can quickly attach to any shape or
            size railing and may extend outward away from and/or inward on the deck, balcony or
            patio. The frame can be made of various durable materials, including but not limited
            to wood (including teak), aluminum, wrought iron, stainless steel, titanium, or a
            polymer/plastic material. The device has a rectangular frame shape, but could be square,
            circular, triangular or any polygonal shape if desired. In addition, the device can
            have one or more points of contact between the railing and the proximal portion of
            the frame for attachment of the device. One benefit of the device is its ability to
            adjust and attach to various shaped railings and various sized railings. The device
            also contains another member which is an additional point of contact from the frame
            to the floor/base of the deck, balcony or patio. This member is angled from the most
            external/distal portion of the frame to the base/floor. This member can be telescoping
            and can be attached to the frame via a hinge in order to allow for it to fold up and
            minimize space of the device when not in use. This member or leg could also occur
            on both sides of the device, with the second member/leg contacting the bottom horizontal
            brace of the railing or balcony.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, a need exists for a lightweight device that can quickly, easily and releasably
            attach to a railing, fence or the like, to provide additional surface area and/or
            additional display area for occupants to place various items including but not limited
            to food items or glasses.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is directed to a railing extension device which provides a
            support frame that releasably attaches to a railing. The device can quickly and easily
            be attached to a railing or fence and then when it is no longer in use it can just
            as quickly and easily be removed and stored. The preferred embodiment of the device
            contains two brackets that mount to the proximal portion of the support frame (hereinafter
            frame). These brackets are permanently attached to the frame and contain an L shaped
            protrusion which accommodates a strap or cable member. The L shaped bracket could
            be replaced with various other well known means for holding the strap or cable in
            place and work just as efficiently. The strap or cable can be made from a variety
            of materials, including but not limited to nylon, rubber (synthetic or natural) or
            stainless steel. The strap member continues through a cinching buckle and can be tightened
            accordingly to maintain the position of the frame. The cinching buckle could also
            be replaced with other well known means for holding tension on a cable or strap and
            work just as well. Other types of tightening mechanisms can be used to tighten and
            secure the strap to the desired tension, including but not limited to a wench type
            mechanism, a rack and pinion type mechanism, or a spring loaded clamp mechanism. The
            strap from the buckle is attached at its other end to a U-shaped bracket. The U shaped
            bracket is moveable and can be of various lengths, widths and sizes and resides sandwiched
            between the frame and the railing. This allows the weight of whatever is put on top
            of the frame to further anchor the device to the railing. The U shaped bracket is
            uniquely locked in place by the use of a detent pin that is inserted through a slot
            in the side of the U shaped bracket and traverses across the entire width of the U
            shaped bracket and out a slot on the opposite side of the U shaped bracket. The pin
            resides in the slots and keeps the U shaped bracket locked in place. Lastly, the distal
            portion of the frame has a telescoping member or leg that is pivotally attached to
            the frame. Once extended, the leg contacts the surface of the deck, balcony or patio
            to provide additional support for the frame.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment the device could contain drop in compartments for various items,
            including but not limited to a cutting board and utensils. It is also contemplated
            that the device could be adapted for marine applications as well as tailgating applications
            or with fences that have a horizontal cross member.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</h1>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">Particular embodiments of the present disclosure will be described herein with reference
            to the accompanying drawings. As shown in the drawings and as described throughout
            the following description, and as is traditional when referring to relative positioning
            on an object, the terms “proximal” and “trailing” may be employed interchangeably,
            and should be understood as referring to the portion of a structure that is closer
            to a user during proper use. The terms “distal” and “leading” may also be employed
            interchangeably, and should be understood as referring to the portion of a structure
            that is farther from the user during proper use.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring initially to figref[FIGS. 1 and 2]
            	, the rail mounting system 
            <b>10</b> consists of a frame 
            <b>20</b>. The frame 
            <b>20</b> can be various shapes, but is D-shaped in the preferred embodiment. In the preferred
            embodiment there are two first strap brackets with an L shaped feature, herein after
            called the L brackets 
            <b>30</b> which are permanently mounted to the proximal portion of the frame 
            <b>20</b> with the use of Phillips head screws, but could also be mounted with various well
            known techniques including but not limited to riveting and welding. Referring additionally
            to figref[FIGS. 4]
            	, 
            <b>5</b>A, 
            <b>5</b>B, 
            <b>12</b> and 
            <b>13</b>, the L brackets 
            <b>30</b> utilize this L shaped member to contain the strapping 
            <b>70</b> and use the vertical portion 
            <b>74</b> of the L shape to prevent it from sliding off the L bracket 
            <b>30</b>. The strapping 
            <b>70</b>, defining a first strap member, continues and connects to a cinching type buckle
            
            <b>72</b> which connects to a second strap member, the second piece of strapping 
            <b>75</b>, that together form a first adjustable strap assembly 
            <b>71</b>. From the buckle 
            <b>72</b> the second piece of strapping 
            <b>75</b> connects to a second strap bracket 
            <b>30</b>
            <i>a </i>of a U shaped bracket 
            <b>40</b> so that the buckle 
            <b>72</b> can be tightened accordingly to maintain the position of the frame. Preferably, two
            U shaped brackets 
            <b>40</b> are used and they are placed between the railing 
            <b>80</b> and the frame 
            <b>20</b>, thus looping the strapping 
            <b>70</b> and 
            <b>75</b> around the railing 
            <b>80</b>. The U shaped bracket 
            <b>40</b> contains a slot 
            <b>46</b> on either side to accommodate detent pin 
            <b>42</b> which is used to attach the U shaped bracket 
            <b>40</b> to the frame 
            <b>20</b>. As noted in figref[FIG. 2]
            	, the frame 
            <b>20</b> has adjustment holes 
            <b>24</b> to accommodate various placement locations of the U shaped bracket 
            <b>40</b>. Once the U shaped bracket 
            <b>40</b> is in place, the strapping 
            <b>70</b>, 
            <b>75</b> can be tightened to secure the frame 
            <b>20</b> to the railing 
            <b>80</b>. The placement of the U shaped bracket 
            <b>40</b> under the frame 
            <b>20</b> and on top of the railing 
            <b>80</b> serves a unique purpose in that it allows for the weight that is placed on the frame
            
            <b>20</b> to further secure the frame 
            <b>20</b> in place.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0031" num="0030">The frame 
            <b>20</b> also contains a post feature 
            <b>25</b> on its distal side. The post feature 
            <b>25</b> comprises two upright members 
            <b>26</b> which have a through hole 
            <b>27</b> for detent pin 
            <b>28</b> to reside. The post 
            <b>25</b> mates with a telescoping leg 
            <b>50</b>, whereby its proximal end also contains a through hole 
            <b>53</b> to mate with detent pin 
            <b>28</b>. The telescoping leg 
            <b>50</b> contains adjustment holes 
            <b>56</b> along its length to accommodate various heights between railing 
            <b>80</b> and floor 
            <b>90</b>. The adjustment holes 
            <b>56</b> utilize detent pin 
            <b>57</b> and through hole 
            <b>54</b> on the upper leg portion to lock the telescoping leg 
            <b>50</b> into place. The telescoping leg 
            <b>50</b> also has a foot 
            <b>52</b> which rests on the floor surface 
            <b>90</b>. The foot 
            <b>52</b> consists of an L shape rigid member that rests on both the top and side surface of
            the floor 
            <b>90</b>. The foot 
            <b>52</b> may also be screwed into place into the floor surface to prevent any movement of
            the telescoping leg 
            <b>50</b>. It is also contemplated that this foot 
            <b>52</b> could be angularly adjustable to accommodate various unevenness that may occur with
            floor surfaces 
            <b>90</b>. The telescoping leg 
            <b>50</b> provides additional support for the railing mounting system 
            <b>10</b>, much like a tripod would by providing a third support point. It is also contemplated
            that there could be more than one telescoping leg to support the frame. The legs may
            be all on the same side of the frame or on both the proximal and distal ends of the
            frame.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0032" num="0031">Lastly, the frame 
            <b>20</b> contains securing tabs 
            <b>62</b> that are mounted to the frame 
            <b>20</b> by screws 
            <b>63</b>. A piece of glass 
            <b>60</b> or metal mesh 
            <b>61</b> is fitted to match the shape of the frame 
            <b>20</b> is placed into the top of the frame 
            <b>20</b> and the securing tabs 
            <b>62</b> are placed over the glass 
            <b>60</b> and alongside the side of the frame 
            <b>20</b> and are screwed into place to prevent the glass 
            <b>60</b> from moving.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0033" num="0032">The rail mounting system 
            <b>10</b> can be utilized for supporting various items including glassware, plates, centerpieces,
            candles etc. The rail mounting system 
            <b>10</b> is designed to be easily removed from the railing 
            <b>80</b> and stored for future use. The various detent pins 
            <b>28</b>, 
            <b>42</b> and
