      <p>A positioning device includes a base, a press board, an antislip piece, and a positioning
         unit. The base includes an opening, and a mounting space. The mounting space is mounted
         on a rod. The press board is slidably mounted in the opening. The antislip piece is
         mounted on the press board and is close to the mounting space. The antislip piece
         is made of elastic material and is softer than the press board. The positioning unit
         includes a shaft mounted on the base and a driving member rotatably and eccentrically
         connected with the shaft. The driving member is driven between a pressing position
         for locking the rod and a releasing position for unlocking the rod. Thus, the user
         only needs to drive the driving member to lock or unlock the rod so that the rod is
         locked or unlocked easily and quickly.

         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional positioning device in accordance with the prior art shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	 is mounted on a rod 
            <b>520</b> and comprises a clamping ring 
            <b>500</b> and a bolt 
            <b>510</b>. The clamping ring 
            <b>500</b> includes a C-shaped annular wall 
            <b>501</b>, two spaced fixing plates 
            <b>502</b> mounted on two opposite ends of the annular wall 
            <b>501</b>, and a slit 
            <b>503</b> defined between the fixing plates 
            <b>502</b>. The clamping ring 
            <b>500</b> is mounted on the rod 
            <b>520</b>. Then, the bolt 
            <b>510</b> is screwed through the fixing plates 
            <b>502</b>. When the bolt 
            <b>510</b> is screwed tightly to reduce the width of the slit 
            <b>503</b>, the annular wall 
            <b>501</b> of the clamping ring 
            <b>500</b> presses the rod 
            <b>520</b> so that the rod 
            <b>520</b> is locked. When the bolt 
            <b>510</b> is unscrewed to enlarge the width of the slit 
            <b>503</b>, the annular wall 
            <b>501</b> of the clamping ring 
            <b>500</b> releases the rod 
            <b>520</b> so that the rod 
            <b>520</b> is unlocked. However, the user has to screw the bolt 
            <b>510</b> for locking the rod 
            <b>520</b> and to unscrew the bolt 
            <b>510</b> for unlocking the rod 
            <b>520</b>, thereby wasting the time and energy. In addition, the annular wall 
            <b>501</b> of the clamping ring 
            <b>500</b> easily produces an elastic fatigue during a long-term utilization so that the annular
            wall 
            <b>501</b> of the clamping ring 
            <b>500</b> cannot position the rod 
            <b>520</b> exactly and closely. Further, the conventional positioning device is not assembled
            conveniently.

         <h1>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a positioning device
            that can lock or unlock a rod conveniently to achieve energy saving and time saving
            functions.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a positioning device mounted
            on a rod, comprising a base, a press board, an antislip piece, and a positioning unit.
            The base includes an outer peripheral face, an inner peripheral face, an opening,
            and a sliding guide module. The inner peripheral face of the base defines a mounting
            space which is mounted on the rod. The opening of the base extends from the inner
            peripheral face to the outer peripheral face of the base. The sliding guide module
            of the base is located adjacent to the opening. The press board is slidably mounted
            in the opening of the base and is close to the mounting space of the base. The press
            board includes a guiding module which is slidable along the sliding guide module of
            the base. The antislip piece is mounted on and protruded outward from the press board.
            The antislip piece is close to the mounting space of the base. The antislip piece
            is made of elastic material and is softer than the press board. The positioning unit
            includes a shaft and a driving member. The shaft of the positioning unit is mounted
            on the base. The driving member of the positioning unit is rotatably and eccentrically
            connected with the shaft. The driving member of the positioning unit includes a pressing
            portion and a handle portion. The pressing portion of the driving member corresponds
            to the opening of the base. The handle portion of the driving member extends laterally
            from the pressing portion. The handle portion of the driving member is driven to move
            the pressing portion relative to the base between a pressing position and a releasing
            position. When the pressing portion of the driving member is moved to the pressing
            position, the pressing portion of the driving member presses the press board toward
            the rod to secure the rod. When the pressing portion of the driving member is moved
            to the releasing position, the pressing portion of the driving member releases the
            press board from the rod so that the rod is movable freely.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The base further includes two pivot plates spaced from each other. Each of the pivot
            plates of the base extends outward from the outer peripheral face of the base. The
            opening of the base is located between the pivot plates. One of the pivot plates of
            the base has a sliding face. The sliding guide module of the base includes at least
            one sliding guide portion formed in the sliding face. The guiding module of the press
            board includes at least one guiding portion slidable along the sliding guide portion
            of the sliding guide module. Preferably, the sliding guide portion of the sliding
            guide module is an elongate channel, and the guiding portion of the guiding module
            is a rail. The sliding guide module of the base further includes a plurality of first
            limit portions which are located at two opposite sides of the opening. The guiding
            module of the press board further includes a plurality of second limit portions secured
            on the first limit portions of the sliding guide module. Preferably, each of the first
            limit portions of the sliding guide module is a recess, and each of the second limit
            portions of the guiding module is a projection. The press board further includes a
            driven face and a fixing face. The driven face of the press board has an arc-shaped
            profile. The fixing face of the press board is located opposite to the driven face.
            The antislip piece is secured in the press board and corresponds to the fixing face
            of the press board. The pressing portion of the driving member presses the driven
            face of the press board. The pressing portion of the driving member has an arc-shaped
            profile. The guiding module of the press board has a bottom side provided with at
            least one oblique face. The oblique face of the guiding module is extended from the
            fixing face of the press board toward the driven face of the press board and is gradually
            deflected downward.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the primary advantage of the present invention, the user only needs to
            drive the driving member to lock or unlock the rod so that the rod is locked or unlocked
            easily and quickly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another advantage of the present invention, the press board and the antislip
            piece clamps the rod the pressing position so that the rod is locked tightly and closely.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a further advantage of the present invention, the antislip piece is sandwiched
            between the rod and the press board so that the press board will not directly contact
            the rod and will not be deformed or distorted during a long-term utilization.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further benefits and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after
            a careful reading of the detailed description with appropriate reference to the accompanying
