            for the latter to be able to move through the air or within a fluid with very large
            freedom of movement thanks to the agility and the physique of the passenger.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention also provides for the system to be very simple to implement and accessible
            to as many people as possible.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moving through space has always been one of the main dreams of mankind. Many machines
            have been produced, each more sophisticated than the last, which aim to achieve this
            dream with greater or lesser success.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, in order to attempt to move with ease through environments as diverse as the
            surface of water or in contact with a sometimes hostile environment, a propulsion
            device such as described in the 1960s in U.S. Pat. No. 3,243,144 or U.S. Pat. No.
            3,381,917 comprises a body in the form of a harness or a seat on which or in which
            a passenger can be positioned. Such a body engages with a thrust unit in particular
            in the form of a pair of nozzles for ejecting a fluid under pressure and thus to generate
            a thrust force. In order to simplify the flight of the passenger and to reduce the
            physical effort thereof, the nozzles are arranged above the centre of gravity of the
            body-passenger assembly, specifically at the height of the passenger's shoulders.
            The unit also includes a fluid-compression station supplied with flammable liquids
            or gases and positioned on the back of the passenger. Said station is capable of supplying
            enough thrust to cause the passenger to take off, transformed into a type of human
            rocket. The low operating range coupled with the dangerousness of such devices have
            caused them to remain relatively confidential.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">More recently, a device such as describes in U.S. Pat. No. 7,258,301 and US patent
            application 2008/0014811 A1 draws inspiration from said teaching, adapting it to reduce
            the dangerousness of the system. The compression station in this case is remote and
            generally dedicated. Furthermore, the pressurised fluid is water compressed by said
            station, drawing inspiration in this regard in particular from experiments aiming
            to use compressed water to reduce the physical effort of a deep-sea diver, as suggested
            in U.S. Pat. No. 3,277,858. U.S. Pat. No. 7,258,301 and US patent application 2008/0014811
            A1 thus propose an airborne propulsion device that is similar to its predecessor,
            adapted such that pressurised water is transported from a remote compression station
            by means of a supply channel such as a fire hose. The configuration of the nozzles
            as well as the means that makes it possible to direct said nozzles in order to determine
            the trajectory of the device are deliberately kept in order to maintain certain ease
            of piloting for the passenger. However, in particular the take-off phase requires
            the passenger to be in an initial standing position, with the feet on a solid surface.
            The physical effort of the passenger to move, reduced to the simplest expression thereof,
            is detrimental to the freedom and the variety of movements on the surface of the water
            or under the surface thereof. Furthermore, such a “device+station” system in accordance
            with U.S. Pat. No. 7,258,301 is expensive due to the design of the device comprising
            hinged nozzles, and to the design of a dedicated compression station. The fact of
            being able to move through space has an intrinsic recreational side. However, the
            configuration of the nozzles located above the centre of gravity of the device gives
            the passenger the impression of hanging by the shoulders from a virtual crane hook,
            and thus deprives the passenger of many sensations: falls, improvised or acrobatic
            style figures. Furthermore, the variety of directions and movements is limited. It
            is not easy, for example, to move “crabwise” with a known device, or to change instantly
            from a straight trajectory on the surface of the water to a diving phase followed
            by multiple movements under the surface of the water.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention offers a response to all the disadvantages raised by the known solutions.
            The invention consists mainly of providing a device in which the design implies a
            break with the prior art. Such a device comprises mainly a substantially planar platform
            on which one or more passengers can be positioned. The take-off and the movements
            are generated by a thrust force supplied by a set of at least three nozzles, two of
            which are free and intended for being held by one of the passengers, said nozzles
            all being arranged such as to be positioned below the centre of gravity of the “device-passengers”
            assembly. It is therefore thanks to their physique and their agility that the passengers
            of said innovative device can control the thrust of the device and perform movements
            and acrobatics with very large freedom and an unrivalled recreational side.

         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to offer such sensations to a large number of users, the invention provides
            the possibility of using known motorised water vehicles (MWV) as a remote compression
            station. The invention does not require the design of dedicated compression stations.

            	 shows an embodiment of a propulsion device 
            <b>10</b> according to the invention. Said device comprises a main body in the form of a substantially
            planar platform 
            <b>11</b>. Said platform comprises a top surface 
            <b>11</b>
            <i>a </i>on which a passenger 
            <b>1</b> can be positioned. According to the size of the platform and the power of the device,
            the invention provides for a plurality of passengers optionally to be able to be positioned
            simultaneously on the top surface 
            <b>11</b>
            <i>a </i>of said platform 
            <b>11</b>. The platform can be advantageously made from one material or a plurality of materials
            having, alone or in combination, enough rigidity to withstand the weight of the passenger
            or passengers and thus to prevent excessive warping. It may be preferable for said
            platform to be made of one material in order to determine the buoyancy of the device
            when the latter is submerged. According to the embodiments, the platform can thus
            have one or more cavities filled with air or a vacuum in order to improve the buoyancy
            thereof. As an alternative, it may be preferable not to include vacuum or cavities
            or to include a ballast in order to make it easier to move under the surface of a
            fluid. Such a platform can comprise one or more elements engaging with one another
            or separate.

         <p id="p-0031" num="0037">For the purpose of the invention and in the present document, the term “nozzle” has
            been used to define a profiled duct element for increasing the speed of a flowing
            fluid. The term “jet pipe” could also be used to describe such an element. This speed
            increase of the fluid is mainly caused by a difference in cross-section between the
            intake and the outlet of the element, the outlet having a smaller cross-section than
            the intake.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0032" num="0038">According to figref[FIG. 1]
            	, such a unit consists of a pair of main nozzles 
            <b>12</b>
            <i>a </i>and 
            <b>12</b>

            <b>11</b>
            <i>b </i>of the platform

            In general terms, the invention is not limited to the number of main nozzles located
            under the bottom surface 
            <b>11</b>
            <i>b </i>of the platform 
            <b>11</b>. The thrust unit thus comprises at least one main nozzle engaging with said bottom

            <i>b </i>is attached by any means to the platform, with no degree of freedom. In order to assist
            the take-off of the device, the direction of every main nozzle advantageously follows
            an axis A preferably substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface of the platform
            such that a main nozzle expels a pressurised fluid from near the bottom surface

            <i>a </i>and 
            <b>13</b>

            when said assembly is straightened out vertically such as indicated in figref[FIG. 1]
            	. Unlike in the prior art, in which the nozzles of the thrust unit are necessarily
            positioned above said centre of gravity CG in order to minimise the physical effort
            of the passenger and to simplify the movements thereof, the main and secondary nozzles
            of the thrust unit of a device 
            <b>10</b> according to the invention are positioned below said centre of gravity CG. A passenger

         <p id="p-0034" num="0040">In order to supply sufficient thrust force and enable take-off and movement, the device
            
            <b>10</b> also comprises a means for collecting and distributing a pressurised fluid (for example
            water) to the main and secondary nozzles. Such a fluid is preferably transported by
            a flexible supply channel 
            <b>2</b> from a remote compression station—not shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	. Such a supply channel can be manufactured from a fire hose or from any other material
            that offers the necessary strength against the pressure exerted by the pressurised
            fluid. It may be preferable, advantageously, to use a supply channel with a diameter
            of substantially 110 millimeters. An excessively small or large diameter would result
            in a considerable loss of thrust force in respect of the compression capacity of the

            For this purpose, the configuration of the nozzles (cross-sections of the respective

         <p id="p-0039" num="0045">figref[FIG. 2]
            	 describes a preferred embodiment of a platform 
            <b>11</b> for a propulsion device according to the invention. Such a substantially planar platform
            
            <b>11</b> comprises—on the top surface thereof 
            <b>11</b>
            <i>a</i>—two spaces for respectively receiving the feet of a passenger, shown as dotted lines.
            Such a platform 
            <b>11</b> is arranged such that the bottom surface 
            <b>11</b>
            <i>b </i>thereof engages with a projecting means 
            <b>17</b> in turn arranged to offer protection for the elements—not shown in FIG. 
            <b>2</b>—of the device located under the bottom surface 
            <b>11</b>
            <i>b </i>of the platform 
            <b>11</b>, in a non-exhaustive manner: the main nozzle or nozzles, the means for collecting
            and distributing a pressurised fluid. Such a means 
            <b>17</b> can thus form supporting points and constitute a protective cage for said elements.
            Any untimely impact or other direct contact between said elements and the immediate
            non-fluid environment thereof can thus be prevented, in particular during take-off
            or landing from dry land, or even when landing on water from shallow water.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0040" num="0046">The selection of the material or materials used for manufacturing the projecting means
            
            <b>17</b> can be determined by the required level of impact protection, the resistance to the
            weight exerted by the passenger or passengers on the platform during the take-off,
            landing or water-landing phases. The projecting means 
            <b>17</b> can also interact with the sought buoyancy of the device according to the structure
            and configuration thereof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0041" num="0047">A passenger of a propulsion device according to the invention can perform a presently
            unrivalled number of movements (in the air, under the surface of an aquatic medium,
            etc.). It can be mentioned that take-off can be carried out—when pressurised fluid
            is supplied to said device—if the passenger holds the secondary nozzles with his or
            her arms stretched towards the rear of his or her body and his or her back arched.
            A dive can, for example, be controlled by said passenger by curving his or her body
            with his or her head towards the front, etc.

         <p id="p-0042" num="0048">In order to ensure easy piloting for the passenger and to grant an increased range
            of action, the invention provides for a propulsion device to be able also to comprise
            a means for controlling the power of the compression station. Thus, when receiving
            an order supplied by said means and carried by an adapted fixed or wireless communication
            means, the station can modulate the compression power of the fluid it supplies to
            the propulsion device. The passenger can thus control, for example, the take-off,
            or even fine-tune the movements thereof by modulating the pressure of the fluid flowing
            through the supply circuit connecting same to the compression station.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0043" num="0049">Furthermore, according to the applications or uses of a propulsion device according
            to the invention, the latter can also comprise a means 
            <b>15</b> (for example in the form of a nozzle) for spraying a pressurised fluid other than
            that used to move the device or derived from same. Said optional means advantageously
            engages with platform 
            <b>11</b> or, alternatively, with the passenger (on a shoulder, at the waist, etc.). The purpose
            herein is to offer a civil security application such as fire-fighting, for example,
            or even for water games: spraying third parties, novel jousting in which the jet of
            the second fluid forms a non-solid lance, preventing the risk of injuries while maintaining
            its function of destabilising an adversary . . . .

            	 and/or 
            <b>2</b>, can be supplied by any remote fluid-compression station as soon as the latter is
            capable of supplying a fluid with high enough pressure for the operation of the propulsion
            device. The latter can be dedicated to said use at the risk of increasing the overall
            cost of a propulsion system comprising a propulsion device according to the invention,
            a remote compression station and a supply channel engaging with said device and station
            in order to transport the pressurised fluid.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0045" num="0051">In order to reduce such cost, the invention also provides for the remote compression
            station to be able to be an apparatus which has a main original function other than
            supplying a pressurised fluid of a propulsion device. As an example, the invention
            provides for a land- or sea-based fire-fighter's vehicle to be used as a remote compression
            station if said vehicle has enough fluid compression capacity. It is therefore possible
            to make use of the natural fluid-compression capacity of a motorised water vehicle
            (MWV) such as, for example, the RUNABOUT MZR 2011 edition, manufactured by ZAPATA
            RACING.

         <p id="p-0046" num="0052">Regardless of the compression station used, the invention provides for said station
            to be able to comprise a means for regulating the compression power from a remote

            station of a propulsion device in accordance with the invention can be made to interact
            with said means for adjusting the power of a station thus adapted. By means of a communication
            means (fixed or wireless) for carrying a control signal issued by the propulsion device
            and sent towards the compression station, a passenger of said device can remotely
            control the power of the station and thus adapt the movements performed using the
            propulsion device.
