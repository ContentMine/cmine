<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> show a tripod head <b>100</b> according to an exemplary embodiment. The tripod head <b>100</b> includes a shell <b>10</b>, an adjusting member <b>20</b>, a supporting member <b>30</b>, and a locking member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The shell <b>10</b> is substantially a hollow cylinder. The shell <b>10</b> includes a sidewall <b>11</b> and an upper plate <b>12</b> connected to an end of the sidewall <b>11</b>. The sidewall <b>11</b> and the upper plate <b>12</b> cooperatively define a receiving space <b>101</b>. The sidewall <b>11</b> includes a substantially ring-shaped flange portion <b>14</b> protruding from an end away from the upper plate <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, the flange portion <b>14</b> is a continuous ring. Alternatively, the flange portion <b>14</b> can be comprised of a number of protruding blocks annularly arranged and spaced from each other. The upper plate <b>12</b> defines a first adjusting opening <b>121</b> communicating with the receiving space <b>101</b>. The first adjusting opening <b>121</b> is substantially round.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The shell <b>10</b> further defines a second adjusting opening <b>102</b> communicating with the first adjusting opening <b>121</b>. The second adjusting opening <b>102</b> extends from the first adjusting opening <b>121</b> perpendicularly away from the upper plate <b>12</b> into the sidewall <b>11</b>. In another embodiment, the second adjusting opening <b>102</b> helically extends away from the upper plate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The adjusting member <b>20</b> includes an adjusting portion <b>21</b> and a connecting portion <b>22</b> connected to the adjusting portion <b>21</b>. The adjusting portion <b>21</b> adjusts a position and angle of the connecting portion <b>22</b> relative to the shell <b>10</b>. The adjusting portion <b>21</b> is substantially spherical. An end of the connecting portion <b>22</b> is fixedly connected to the adjusting portion <b>21</b>. The end of the connecting portion <b>22</b> away from the adjusting portion <b>21</b> connects to a camera (not shown) by a suitable connection means.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The supporting member <b>30</b> includes a threaded portion <b>31</b> and a supporting portion <b>32</b> connected to the threaded portion <b>31</b>. The threaded portion <b>31</b> is substantially cylindrical. The threaded portion <b>31</b> defines a connecting hole <b>311</b> defined in an end away from the supporting portion <b>32</b>. The connecting hole <b>311</b> connects to a tripod (not shown). The connecting hole <b>311</b> is an internally threaded hole. The supporting portion <b>32</b> is fixedly connected to an end of the threaded portion <b>31</b>. The supporting portion <b>32</b> includes a supporting surface <b>321</b> away from the threaded portion <b>31</b>. The supporting surface <b>321</b> is concave and is conformed to the shape of the adjusting portion <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The locking member <b>40</b> locks the adjusting member <b>20</b> in the shell <b>10</b>. The locking member <b>40</b> includes a first plate <b>41</b> and a second plate <b>42</b>. The first plate <b>41</b> defines a threaded hole <b>411</b> in its center. The threaded hole <b>411</b> receives the threaded portion <b>31</b> of the supporting member <b>30</b> so as to firmly connect the supporting member <b>30</b> to the locking member <b>40</b>. A thickness of the central portion of the first plate <b>41</b> is larger that of a peripheral portion of the first plate <b>41</b> surrounding the central portion, thus to elongate an axial length of the threaded hole <b>411</b>. Therefore, a steady connection between the supporting member <b>30</b> and the locking member <b>40</b> can be ensured. The first plate <b>41</b> is substantially circular. Alternatively, the first plate <b>41</b> can be polygonal-shaped, such as a rectangular, triangular, or the like. The first plate <b>41</b> includes a protrusion portion <b>412</b> around its periphery. The protrusion portion <b>412</b> protrudes along a direction substantially parallel to a central axis of the threaded hole <b>411</b>. The protrusion portion <b>412</b> is a continuous ring around the periphery of the first plate <b>41</b>. Alternatively, the protrusion portion <b>412</b> can be comprised of a number of protrusions spaced apart. The first plate <b>41</b> defines a number of first connecting holes <b>413</b> around the threaded hole <b>411</b>. The first connecting holes <b>413</b> are threaded holes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second plate <b>42</b> defines a substantially circular through hole <b>421</b> in its center. The size of the through hole <b>421</b> allows the shell <b>10</b>, but not the flange portion <b>14</b>, to pass through. In this embodiment, the through hole <b>421</b> is substantially circular-shaped, and a diameter of the through hole <b>421</b> is larger than an outer diameter of the sidewall <b>11</b> and less than an outer diameter of the flange portion <b>14</b>. The second plate <b>42</b> defines a recess portion <b>422</b> surrounding the through hole <b>421</b>. A size and shape of the recess portion <b>422</b> accommodate a size and shape of the flange portion <b>14</b>. A shape of the second plate <b>42</b> accommodates a shape of an inner side surface of the protrusion portion <b>412</b>. The second plate <b>42</b> defines a number of second connecting holes <b>423</b> corresponding to the first connecting holes <b>413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The first plate <b>41</b> and the second plate <b>42</b> are fixedly connected to each other by fixing members (not shown), such as bolts or rivets. In this embodiment, the fixing members are bolts. The fixing members pass through the second connecting holes <b>423</b> into the corresponding first connecting holes <b>413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The tripod head <b>100</b> further includes a pad <b>50</b>. The pad <b>50</b> is substantially ring-shaped, and the pad <b>50</b> has a truncated conical outer side surface. The pad <b>50</b> defines an opening <b>51</b> corresponding to the second adjusting opening <b>102</b>. In this embodiment, the pad <b>50</b> is made of rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, in assembly, the adjusting member <b>20</b> is received in the receiving space <b>101</b>, the connecting portion <b>22</b> passes out of the shell <b>10</b> through the first adjusting opening <b>121</b> or the second adjusting opening <b>102</b>, and the pad <b>50</b> is positioned between the adjusting portion <b>21</b> and an inner surface of the shell <b>10</b>. The opening <b>51</b> is aligned with the second adjusting opening <b>102</b>. An end of the shell <b>10</b> with the upper plate <b>12</b> passes through the through hole <b>421</b> so that the flange portion <b>14</b> abuts against the recess portion <b>422</b>. The threaded portion <b>31</b> of the supporting member <b>30</b> screws into the threaded hole <b>411</b>. The first plate <b>41</b> and the second plate <b>42</b> are fixed to each other so that the flange portion <b>14</b> is sandwiched between them. The supporting portion <b>32</b> inserts into the receiving space <b>101</b> of the shell <b>10</b>, and the supporting surface <b>321</b> supports the adjusting portion <b>21</b>. The locking member <b>40</b> is rotatably connected to the supporting member <b>30</b>, such that when the locking member <b>40</b> is rotated relative to the supporting member <b>30</b>, the locking member <b>40</b> locks or unlocks the adjusting portion <b>21</b> in the receiving space <b>101</b>. In this embodiment, when the locking member <b>40</b> is rotated along a clockwise direction, the locking member <b>40</b> moves toward the supporting portion <b>32</b>; when the locking member <b>40</b> is rotated along a counterclockwise direction, the locking member <b>40</b> moves away from the supporting portion <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In use, the tripod head <b>100</b> is fixed on the tripod (not shown), and a camera (not shown) is fixedly connected to the connecting portion <b>22</b> of the adjusting member <b>20</b>. Before shooting, the adjusting portion <b>21</b> is unlocked in the receiving space <b>101</b>, and a position and shooting angle of the camera is adjusted. The position and shooting angle of the camera is adjusted by moving the connecting portion <b>22</b> in the first adjusting opening <b>121</b> and/or the second adjusting opening <b>102</b>. The second adjusting opening <b>102</b> allows the camera to be adjusted vertically or horizontally.</p>
