<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application 61/573,145 filed Sep. 14, 2011.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to a railing extension device for supporting various articles, and more specifically to a device that mounts to a railing and can support various items, including but not limited to a beverage cooler, trash can, a cooler, an electric grill, a glass surface for containing serving dishes and glasses, plants and/or an herb garden.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Decks, balconies and patios are prevalent in homes and restaurants and often contain a railing system of sorts to assist in providing a safety measure and barrier for occupants as decks, balconies and patios are often above ground level and/or may be near hazards such as water. Most decks, balconies and patios contain tables and chairs in order to provide places for people to eat and put their beverage glasses. The addition of tables and chairs often limits the amount of space available for people to stand and/or walk around on. Due to this, occupants often place plates and glasses on railings. These can easily be knocked off or slide off as the surface of the railing is not even due to warping or in the case of balconies the railing may only be one inch wide and therefore not useable for holding items.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To meet the problem of providing additional surface space for decks and patios, a frame and strap system has been developed which can quickly attach to any shape or size railing and may extend outward away from and/or inward on the deck, balcony or patio. The frame can be made of various durable materials, including but not limited to wood (including teak), aluminum, wrought iron, stainless steel, titanium, or a polymer/plastic material. The device has a rectangular frame shape, but could be square, circular, triangular or any polygonal shape if desired. In addition, the device can have one or more points of contact between the railing and the proximal portion of the frame for attachment of the device. One benefit of the device is its ability to adjust and attach to various shaped railings and various sized railings. The device also contains another member which is an additional point of contact from the frame to the floor/base of the deck, balcony or patio. This member is angled from the most external/distal portion of the frame to the base/floor. This member can be telescoping and can be attached to the frame via a hinge in order to allow for it to fold up and minimize space of the device when not in use. This member or leg could also occur on both sides of the device, with the second member/leg contacting the bottom horizontal brace of the railing or balcony.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, a need exists for a lightweight device that can quickly, easily and releasably attach to a railing, fence or the like, to provide additional surface area and/or additional display area for occupants to place various items including but not limited to food items or glasses.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is directed to a railing extension device which provides a support frame that releasably attaches to a railing. The device can quickly and easily be attached to a railing or fence and then when it is no longer in use it can just as quickly and easily be removed and stored. The preferred embodiment of the device contains two brackets that mount to the proximal portion of the support frame (hereinafter frame). These brackets are permanently attached to the frame and contain an L shaped protrusion which accommodates a strap or cable member. The L shaped bracket could be replaced with various other well known means for holding the strap or cable in place and work just as efficiently. The strap or cable can be made from a variety of materials, including but not limited to nylon, rubber (synthetic or natural) or stainless steel. The strap member continues through a cinching buckle and can be tightened accordingly to maintain the position of the frame. The cinching buckle could also be replaced with other well known means for holding tension on a cable or strap and work just as well. Other types of tightening mechanisms can be used to tighten and secure the strap to the desired tension, including but not limited to a wench type mechanism, a rack and pinion type mechanism, or a spring loaded clamp mechanism. The strap from the buckle is attached at its other end to a U-shaped bracket. The U shaped bracket is moveable and can be of various lengths, widths and sizes and resides sandwiched between the frame and the railing. This allows the weight of whatever is put on top of the frame to further anchor the device to the railing. The U shaped bracket is uniquely locked in place by the use of a detent pin that is inserted through a slot in the side of the U shaped bracket and traverses across the entire width of the U shaped bracket and out a slot on the opposite side of the U shaped bracket. The pin resides in the slots and keeps the U shaped bracket locked in place. Lastly, the distal portion of the frame has a telescoping member or leg that is pivotally attached to the frame. Once extended, the leg contacts the surface of the deck, balcony or patio to provide additional support for the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment the device could contain drop in compartments for various items, including but not limited to a cutting board and utensils. It is also contemplated that the device could be adapted for marine applications as well as tailgating applications or with fences that have a horizontal cross member.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Particular embodiments of the present disclosure will be described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings. As shown in the drawings and as described throughout the following description, and as is traditional when referring to relative positioning on an object, the terms &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; and &#x201c;trailing&#x201d; may be employed interchangeably, and should be understood as referring to the portion of a structure that is closer to a user during proper use. The terms &#x201c;distal&#x201d; and &#x201c;leading&#x201d; may also be employed interchangeably, and should be understood as referring to the portion of a structure that is farther from the user during proper use.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the rail mounting system <b>10</b> consists of a frame <b>20</b>. The frame <b>20</b> can be various shapes, but is D-shaped in the preferred embodiment. In the preferred embodiment there are two first strap brackets with an L shaped feature, herein after called the L brackets <b>30</b> which are permanently mounted to the proximal portion of the frame <b>20</b> with the use of Phillips head screws, but could also be mounted with various well known techniques including but not limited to riveting and welding. Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, the L brackets <b>30</b> utilize this L shaped member to contain the strapping <b>70</b> and use the vertical portion <b>74</b> of the L shape to prevent it from sliding off the L bracket <b>30</b>. The strapping <b>70</b>, defining a first strap member, continues and connects to a cinching type buckle <b>72</b> which connects to a second strap member, the second piece of strapping <b>75</b>, that together form a first adjustable strap assembly <b>71</b>. From the buckle <b>72</b> the second piece of strapping <b>75</b> connects to a second strap bracket <b>30</b><i>a </i>of a U shaped bracket <b>40</b> so that the buckle <b>72</b> can be tightened accordingly to maintain the position of the frame. Preferably, two U shaped brackets <b>40</b> are used and they are placed between the railing <b>80</b> and the frame <b>20</b>, thus looping the strapping <b>70</b> and <b>75</b> around the railing <b>80</b>. The U shaped bracket <b>40</b> contains a slot <b>46</b> on either side to accommodate detent pin <b>42</b> which is used to attach the U shaped bracket <b>40</b> to the frame <b>20</b>. As noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the frame <b>20</b> has adjustment holes <b>24</b> to accommodate various placement locations of the U shaped bracket <b>40</b>. Once the U shaped bracket <b>40</b> is in place, the strapping <b>70</b>, <b>75</b> can be tightened to secure the frame <b>20</b> to the railing <b>80</b>. The placement of the U shaped bracket <b>40</b> under the frame <b>20</b> and on top of the railing <b>80</b> serves a unique purpose in that it allows for the weight that is placed on the frame <b>20</b> to further secure the frame <b>20</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The frame <b>20</b> also contains a post feature <b>25</b> on its distal side. The post feature <b>25</b> comprises two upright members <b>26</b> which have a through hole <b>27</b> for detent pin <b>28</b> to reside. The post <b>25</b> mates with a telescoping leg <b>50</b>, whereby its proximal end also contains a through hole <b>53</b> to mate with detent pin <b>28</b>. The telescoping leg <b>50</b> contains adjustment holes <b>56</b> along its length to accommodate various heights between railing <b>80</b> and floor <b>90</b>. The adjustment holes <b>56</b> utilize detent pin <b>57</b> and through hole <b>54</b> on the upper leg portion to lock the telescoping leg <b>50</b> into place. The telescoping leg <b>50</b> also has a foot <b>52</b> which rests on the floor surface <b>90</b>. The foot <b>52</b> consists of an L shape rigid member that rests on both the top and side surface of the floor <b>90</b>. The foot <b>52</b> may also be screwed into place into the floor surface to prevent any movement of the telescoping leg <b>50</b>. It is also contemplated that this foot <b>52</b> could be angularly adjustable to accommodate various unevenness that may occur with floor surfaces <b>90</b>. The telescoping leg <b>50</b> provides additional support for the railing mounting system <b>10</b>, much like a tripod would by providing a third support point. It is also contemplated that there could be more than one telescoping leg to support the frame. The legs may be all on the same side of the frame or on both the proximal and distal ends of the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Lastly, the frame <b>20</b> contains securing tabs <b>62</b> that are mounted to the frame <b>20</b> by screws <b>63</b>. A piece of glass <b>60</b> or metal mesh <b>61</b> is fitted to match the shape of the frame <b>20</b> is placed into the top of the frame <b>20</b> and the securing tabs <b>62</b> are placed over the glass <b>60</b> and alongside the side of the frame <b>20</b> and are screwed into place to prevent the glass <b>60</b> from moving.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The rail mounting system <b>10</b> can be utilized for supporting various items including glassware, plates, centerpieces, candles etc. The rail mounting system <b>10</b> is designed to be easily removed from the railing <b>80</b> and stored for future use. The various detent pins <b>28</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>57</b> need just be removed and the telescoping leg <b>50</b> retracted, and the frame <b>20</b> with the glass <b>60</b> secured in place can be lifted off the railing <b>80</b> and the unit stored for later use.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another embodiment, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the third strap member <b>70</b><i>a </i>and fourth strap member <b>75</b><i>a </i>of each of a pair of second adjustable strap assemblies <b>71</b><i>a </i>span from the proximal part of the frame <b>20</b> to the distal part of the frame <b>20</b> and hangs loosely between the two ends of the frame <b>20</b>. The third strap member <b>70</b><i>a </i>and fourth strap member <b>75</b><i>a </i>each being coupled to a respective fixed strap bracket with an L shaped feature <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Next a cooler can be placed through the frame <b>20</b> and into contact with the third strap member <b>70</b><i>a </i>and fourth strap member <b>75</b><i>a </i>such that the bottom surface of the cooler touches the top surface of the strapping third strap member <b>70</b><i>a </i>and fourth strap member <b>75</b><i>a </i>and holds the cooler upright with the additional support of the frame <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another embodiment, the frame and brackets could be formed monolithically.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In yet another embodiment, the frame <b>20</b> may span both inside and outside the deck, balcony or patio perimeter as noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As shown, the frame <b>20</b> is secured to the railing <b>80</b> with a pair of adjustable strap assemblies <b>71</b>, each adjustable strap assembly <b>71</b> connects between a first U shaped bracket <b>40</b> and second U shaped bracket <b>40</b><i>a </i>that are each coupled to the frame <b>20</b> by respective detent pins <b>42</b> to oppose one another. This provides more surface area for containing various items including but not limited to a drop in tray that may contain recesses for holding utensils or for various herbs. This embodiment contains two telescoping arms <b>50</b> to provide support on both sides of the railing <b>80</b> since the frame <b>20</b> spans across both sides of the railing <b>80</b>. The telescoping arm <b>50</b> that resides inside the railing rests on the bottom horizontal cross member of the railing, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In yet another embodiment, the device may be installed such that it is extending inward from the railing as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, to serve as a table or countertop for instance.</p>
