<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a cable tray apparatus for use with a people mover system such as a Sky Train or the like. Even more particularly, the cable trays which make up the cable tray apparatus of this invention are identical and are secured together in an end-to-end relationship at one side of the cars of the people mover system. Even more particularly, this invention relates to a means for securing the cable trays together which permits the cable trays to be selectively laterally horizontally adjustable with respect to one another and selectively vertically adjustable with respect to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In people mover systems such as a Sky Train system, a plurality of vehicles or cars travel along a guideway or roadway with the guideway or roadway being normally elevated. Power and control signals for the cars normally comprise cables positioned in trays which are positioned on the roadway on one side of the cars traveling on the roadway. In the past, it is believed that the cable trays had to be cut and welded together to accommodate curves in the roadway and to accommodate elevational changes in the roadway.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key aspects or essential aspects of the claimed subject matter. Moreover, this Summary is not intended for use as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A cable tray apparatus is provided for use with an electric train such as a Sky Train which travels along a power rail positioned on a roadway with the train including one or more cars having opposite sides. A plurality of generally rectangular electrical cable trays make up the cable tray apparatus with the cable trays having first and second ends and being identical to one another. The cable trays are connected together in an end-to-end relationship and are positioned on the roadway at one side of the cars of the train. The cable trays are selectively laterally horizontally adjustable with respect to one another and are selectively vertically adjustable with respect to one another to correspond to curves in the roadway and to correspond to elevational changes in the roadway respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each of the cable trays include a body portion having a cover selectively removably mounted on the upper end thereof. A plurality of upstanding partitions are provided in each of the body portions of the cable trays to provide a compartment for low-voltage cables, a compartment for high-voltage cables and a compartment for cables carrying control signals for the cars. The partitions not only stabilize the body portion but act as heat sinks.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One or more low-voltage lights are secured to one side of each of the cable trays which illuminate the roadway adjacent the cable tray apparatus. The cable tray apparatus will serve as a walkway or step to a walkway should the passengers be required to leave the car if the car becomes disabled and must stop along the length of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The cover is selectively removably secured to the upper end of the body portion and the upper end of the partitions and is connected to the body portion by a flexible tether means so that the cover may be placed at one side of the cable tray should the cover need to be removed with the tether preventing the cover from falling from the roadway.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other objects will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cable tray apparatus of this invention is designed, as stated above, to be used with the Sky Train people mover system being constructed in Phoenix, Ariz. The cable tray apparatus <b>10</b> will be supported on the roadway <b>206</b> at one side of the vehicle or car <b>212</b>. Two of the cable tray apparatuses may be positioned between a pair of the vehicles <b>212</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or at one side of the vehicle <b>212</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The vehicles <b>212</b> have guide wheels <b>214</b> which roll along tire running surfaces <b>216</b> in conventional fashion. A guidebeam <b>218</b> is supported by roadway <b>206</b> between the surfaces <b>216</b>. An electric power rail is associated with guidebeam <b>218</b> to provide power to the vehicle and to provide signals to the vehicle. A low voltage power conduit is positioned within body portion <b>14</b> outwardly of partition <b>72</b> for supplying low voltage to the lights <b>222</b> which are secured to the outer surface of wall portion <b>34</b> of body portion <b>14</b>.

The upper surface of cover <b>15</b> of the cable tray apparatus forms sidewalks for passenger use should the vehicle become disabled and stop at any point along the roadway.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The tethers <b>198</b> and <b>200</b> permit the cover <b>15</b> to be placed in an upside-down manner next to the cable tray should entry into the cable tray <b>12</b> be necessary. The tethers prevent the cover <b>15</b>, when removed, from being blown from the roadway <b>206</b> and possibly injuring someone. The partitions <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> not only provide stability to body portion <b>14</b> and cover <b>15</b> but also act as heat sinks. The U-shaped brackets <b>186</b>, <b>188</b>, <b>190</b>, <b>192</b>, <b>194</b> and <b>196</b> not only provide strength to the cover <b>15</b> but also stabilize the side walls of body portion <b>14</b> and partitions <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The connector plates <b>112</b>, <b>118</b> and <b>124</b> permit the cable trays <b>12</b> to be secured to one another in an end-to-end relationship but also permit the cable trays <b>12</b> to be selectively vertically adjusted with respect to one another to correspond to roadways which are inclined either upwardly or downwardly and to permit the cable trays <b>12</b> to be selectively horizontally adjusted with respect to one another to correspond to roadways which turn either right or left such as in curves. The connector plates <b>112</b>, <b>118</b> and <b>124</b> and their connection to the partitions <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> and the body portion <b>14</b> permit horizontal and vertical displacement between adjacent cable trays <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the manner in which the cable trays <b>12</b> may be selectively vertically adjusted with respect to one another while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the manner in which the cable trays <b>12</b> may be selectively laterally horizontally adjusted with respect to one another. As seen, such movement is achieved by certain of the screws and studs being slidably received by slots.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Thus it can be seen that the invention accomplishes at last all of its stated objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although the invention has been described in language that is specific to certain structures and methodological steps, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific structures and/or steps described.
