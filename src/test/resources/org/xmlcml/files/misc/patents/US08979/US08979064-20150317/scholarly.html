      <p>A positioner includes a shift magnitude calculating portion that calculates a shift
         magnitude from the equilibrium state of a pilot relay, from an input air pressure
         that is inputted into the pilot relay and an output air pressure that is outputted
         from the pilot relay. A control calculating portion determines a control signal from
         an actual opening signal, an opening setting value, and the shift magnitude from the
         equilibrium state of the pilot relay that is calculated by the shift magnitude calculating
         portion, and outputs it to the electropneumatic converter.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, positioners for controlling the openings of valves have been, for
            example, positioners wherein the critical components have been configured as illustrated
            in figref[FIG. 3]
            	. In this figure, 
            <b>200</b> (
            <b>200</b>A) is a positioner, and 
            <b>300</b> is a valve, where the valve 
            <b>300</b> is provided with a position sensor 
            <b>10</b> for detecting a position that indicates the degree of opening of the valve.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">The positioner 
            <b>200</b>A is provided with an electric current-SP converting portion 
            <b>1</b>, a control calculating portion 
            <b>2</b>, an electropneumatic converter 
            <b>3</b>, a pilot relay 
            <b>4</b>, and a valve opening calculating portion 
            <b>5</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the positioner 
            <b>200</b>A, the electric current-SP converting portion 
            <b>1</b> converts into an opening setting signal SP an input signal that is sent, as a signal
            of between 4 and 20 mA, from a higher level device. The valve opening calculating
            portion 
            <b>5</b> calculates the current valve opening of the valve 
            <b>200</b>A from the position that indicates the opening of the valve, detected by the position
            sensor 
            <b>10</b>, and outputs, as an actual opening signal PV, a signal depending on the calculated
            opening. The control calculating portion 
            <b>2</b> calculates the difference between the opening setting signal SP from the electric
            current-SP converting portion 
            <b>1</b> and the actual opening signal PV from the valve opening calculating portion 
            <b>5</b>, and outputs, as a control signal MV, an electric signal obtained through performing
            PID control calculations on the difference.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">The electropneumatic converter 
            <b>3</b> converts into an air pressure (a nozzle back pressure) Pn the control signal MV from
            the control calculating portion 
            <b>2</b>. The pilot relay 
            <b>4</b> uses the pneumatic signal Pn from the electropneumatic converter 
            <b>3</b> as an input air pressure and amplifies this input air pressure Pn to produce an output
            air pressure Po, and outputs it to the operating device 
            <b>11</b> of the valve 
            <b>300</b>. Doing so causes the air of the air pressure Po to flow into a diaphragm chamber
            within the operating device 
            <b>11</b>, to adjust the opening of the valve portion 
            <b>12</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this positioner 
            <b>200</b>A, that which is subject to control by the control calculating portion 
            <b>2</b> includes the electropneumatic converter 
            <b>3</b> and the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b>, which apply the air flow rate and the air pressure to the valve 
            <b>300</b>. If the characteristics of the electropneumatic converter 
            <b>3</b> and the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b> were linear, and were well-behaved characteristics, then such a control method would
            be adequate; however, in practice both the electropneumatic converter and the pilot
            relay 
            <b>4</b> have non-linear elements such as hysteresis and a dead band, and so control is complex.
            Given this, because in the positioner 
            <b>200</b>A the feedback information is only the actual opening signal PV of the valve 
            <b>300</b>, if a change does not appear in the actual opening signal PV, then there is no change
            in the control output (the control signal MV). Because of this, controllability is
            a problem. Given this, a positioner with improved controllability has been proposed
            in Japanese Patent 3595554 (“the JP '554”).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">figref[FIG. 4]
            	 is a diagram illustrating schematically the positioner shown in the JP '554. In this
            positioner 
            <b>200</b> (
            <b>200</b>B), the differential value dPo/dt of the output air pressure Po that is outputted
            from the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b>, as a pressure differential value, is fed back to the control calculating portion
            
            <b>2</b> in addition to the actual opening signal PV that indicates the current degree of
            opening of the valve 
            <b>300</b>. The output air pressure Po changes more rapidly than the actual opening signal PV.
            Because of this, feeding back the magnitude of change of the output air pressure Po
            makes it possible to estimate, in advance, the change that will occur in the actual
            opening signal PV. This enables superior control when compared to that of feeding
            back only the opening information.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in the positioner 
            <b>200</b>B disclosed in the JP '554, even though the differential information for the output
            air pressure Po (the control pressure for the diaphragm portion of the operating device
            
            <b>11</b>) of the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b>, wherein the response is faster than that of the actual opening of the valve 
            <b>300</b>, is fed back, when there is a noise, and the like, in the differential information,
            the output becomes extremely large. Because of this, there is a problem in that the
            control tends to become unstable.

         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention was created in order to solve the problem as set forth above,
            and an aspect thereof is to provide a positioner that improves substantially responsiveness
            without a loss of settling performance in control.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to achieve the aspect set forth above, the present invention is a positioner
            including a control calculating portion that inputs an opening setting signal for
            a valve, sent from a higher level device, and an actual opening signal that indicates
            the current degree of opening of the valve, to produce a control signal from the opening
            setting signal and the actual opening signal, an electropneumatic converter that converts
            the control signal from the control calculating portion into an air pressure, and
            a pilot relay that uses, as an input air pressure, the air pressure converted by the
            electropneumatic converter, to amplify the input air pressure to produce an output
            air pressure, to output to driving unit that drives the valve. The positioner further
            includes a shift magnitude calculating portion that calculates a shift magnitude from
            the equilibrium state of the pilot relay from the input air pressure that is inputted
            into the pilot relay and the output air pressure that is outputted from the pilot
            relay. The control calculating unit determines the control output to the electropneumatic
            converter from the actual opening signal, the opening setting signal, and the shift
            magnitude from the equilibrium state of the pilot relay.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">While the output air pressure of the pilot relay is determined in response to the
            input air pressure, when there has been a change in the input air pressure from the
            equilibrium state, there will be a delay until the output air pressure response. In
            the present invention a magnitude of shift from the equilibrium state of the pilot
            relay is calculated from the input air pressure that is inputted into the pilot relay
            and the output air pressure that is outputted from the pilot relay, to determine the
            control output to the electropneumatic converter by taking into consideration the
            magnitude of shift from the equilibrium state of the pilot relay, that is, prior to
            the actual change, the magnitude of change in the output air pressure, which changes
            in response to a change in the input air pressure into the pilot relay, is estimated
            in advance, to thereby improve the responsiveness without a loss of settling performance
            in control.

         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, in the present invention the magnitude of shift from the equilibrium
            state of the pilot relay is calculated as Po−(K·Pn−F). Here Pn is the input air pressure
            that is inputted into the pilot relay, Po is the output air pressure, F is the force
            required before Po starts to change, and K is dPo/dPn.

         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">An example according to the present invention will be explained below in detail, based
            on the drawings. figref[FIG. 1]
            	 is a diagram illustrating the configuration of the critical portions in an example

            <b>100</b> is provided with a shift magnitude calculating portion

         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">The magnitude of shift d from the equilibrium state of the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b>, calculated by the shift magnitude calculating portion 
            <b>6</b>, estimates, prior to the actual change, the magnitude of change of the output air
            pressure Po that changes in response to a change in the input air pressure Pn that
            is inputted into the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b>. figref[FIG. 2]
            	 illustrates the input/output characteristics of the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b>. The output air pressure Po of the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b> changes in accordance with an equation expressed by Po=K·Pn−F, as indicated by the
            input/output characteristic I. When the relationship of the input air pressure Pn
            and the output air pressure Po is on this input/output characteristic I, the pilot
            relay 
            <b>4</b> is in the equilibrium state.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the equilibrium state of the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b>, the output air pressure Po assumes a value that depends on the input air pressure
            Pn. However, because the response of the output air pressure Po is delayed when compared
            to the input air pressure Pn, for some time after a change in the input air pressure
            Pn there will be a deviation from this input/output characteristic I. In this case,
            we can consider the cases wherein the current output air pressure Po is such that
            K·Pn−F&gt;Po and wherein the current output air pressure Po is such that K·Pn−F&lt;Po. In
            the case that the current output air pressure Po is such that K·Pn−F&gt;Po (the (
            <b>1</b>) state illustrated in figref[FIG. 2]
            	), we can anticipate the output air pressure Po to increase by the magnitude of shift
            d from the equilibrium state. In the case that the current output air pressure Po
            is such that K·Pn−F&lt;Po (the (
            <b>2</b>) state illustrated in figref[FIG. 2]
            	), we can anticipate the output air pressure Po to decrease by the magnitude of shift
            d from the equilibrium state.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">Consequently, the magnitude of shift d from the equilibrium state of the pilot relay
            
            <b>4</b> can be said to be an estimate, prior to an actual change, of the magnitude of change
            in the output air pressure Po that changes in response to a change in the input air
            pressure Pn that is inputted into the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b>. The shift magnitude d from the equilibrium state of the pilot relay 
            <b>4</b> is calculated as Po−(K·Pn−F) in the shift magnitude calculating portion 
            <b>6</b>, and this calculated shift magnitude d is sent to the control calculating portion
            
            <b>2</b>. The shift magnitude d is an estimate of the amount of change there will be in the
            output air pressure Po, so by feeding this back it is possible to estimate the change
            in opening at an earlier stage than when feeding back the amount of change in the
            output air pressure Po. Because of this, the controllability is improved substantially.
