      <p>A standoff support for spacing a ladder and ladder jack from a roof. Two pairs of
         rods are pivotably mounted to a horizontally extending member mounted atop a ladder
         jack secured to a ladder. The rods are extended outwardly from the mounting member
         to stabilize and limit movement of the ladder jack and ladder relative to the roof.

         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of supports used to hold a ladder
            in stable relationship to a slanted or unslanted roof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ladder jacks, one example of which is shown in figref[FIGS. 1 and 2]
            	, are devices that are used to mount to a ladder for supporting a scaffold or other
            platform atop the ladder jack. Ladder jacks are commercially available. For example,
            ladder jacks are available from Werner Co. Corporate Headquarters, 93 Werner Road,
            Greenville, Pa. 16125.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical ladder jack 
            <b>30</b> (figref[FIGS. 1 and 2]
            	) includes a horizontally extending member 
            <b>31</b> pivotally and slideably mounted to the top end of angular member 
            <b>32</b>. Member 
            <b>31</b> is also pivotally mounted to a downwardly extending member 
            <b>33</b> having a bottom end pivotally mounted to the bottom of angular member 
            <b>32</b>. A pair of downwardly opening C-shaped walls 
            <b>34</b> and 
            <b>35</b> attached to member 
            <b>33</b> are slipped over the horizontally extending rungs of a conventional extension ladder
            
            <b>40</b>. A scaffold or platform 
            <b>41</b> rests atop and is supported by member 
            <b>31</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, two ladder jacks are positioned one at each end of scaffold 
            <b>41</b> to support the opposite ends thereof and thus, a pair of extension ladders are used
            with each ladder receiving a ladder jack. figref[FIG. 1]
            	 shows one such ladder jack mounted to a ladder and supporting one end of the scaffold.
            figref[FIG. 2]
            	 shows the same ladder jack only with the scaffold removed to illustrate features
            present atop horizontal member 
            <b>31</b>. A right angle bracket 
            <b>43</b> has its horizontal flange fixedly attached to the distal end 
            <b>49</b> of horizontal member 
            <b>31</b> and also has a vertically extending portion 
            <b>44</b> that extends upwardly from member 
            <b>31</b>. Member 
            <b>31</b> includes a horizontally extending slot 
            <b>45</b> with a conventional fastener 
            <b>47</b> extending through the slot. A downwardly opening C-shaped clamp 
            <b>48</b> is mounted to member 
            <b>31</b> by fastener 
            <b>47</b> and provides a stop surface for any movement of the scaffold toward the distal end

         <h1>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</h1>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention,
            reference will now be made to the embodiment illustrated in the drawings and specific
            language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that
            no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations
            and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications
            of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein being contemplated as would
            normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">When utilizing an extension ladder to provide access for a worker to the top portion
            of a building and even the roof itself, the ladder may be rested against the building.
            Pressure from the ladder as the worker stands on the ladder may result in damage to
            the building including gutters and shingles. I have therefore combined a standoff
            device with the previously described ladder jack. In most cases the roof will slant
            thereby decreasing the stability of the ladder as it rests against the building.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to figref[FIG. 3]
            	, an alternate embodiment of the standoff device 
            <b>20</b> includes a pair of upright right angle posts 
            <b>21</b> and 
            <b>22</b> connected together by horizontally extending member 
            <b>23</b>. The opposite ends of member 
            <b>23</b> are secured to posts 
            <b>21</b> and 
            <b>22</b> by conventional bolt/nut combinations. Each post 
            <b>21</b> and 
            <b>22</b> includes a series of holes extending there through along the length of each post
            enabling member 
            <b>23</b> to be connected to the post at various locations along the length of the posts.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">Roof 
            <b>24</b> has a downward slant as viewed from the left to the right in figref[FIG. 3]
            	. End 
            <b>25</b> of member 
            <b>23</b> is mounted toward the top end of post 
            <b>21</b> while end 
            <b>26</b> of member 
            <b>23</b> is mounted toward the bottom end of post 
            <b>22</b> to position member 
            <b>23</b> horizontally thereby maintaining member 
            <b>23</b> in a horizontal position.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">An eye bolt 
            <b>60</b> is fixedly attached to the center of member 
            <b>23</b>. Stabilizing rods 
            <b>61</b> and 
            <b>62</b> (figref[FIG. 3]
            	) have top ends pivotally connected to the ring shaped outer end 
            <b>63</b> (figref[FIG. 4]
            	) of eye bolt 
            <b>60</b>. The bottom ends 
            <b>64</b> and 
            <b>65</b> respectively of stabilizing rods 
            <b>61</b> and 
            <b>62</b> are bent at an angle with respect to the main body of each rod so the top end of
            each rod may be moved and pivoted in the ring shaped end 
            <b>63</b> to allow ends 
            <b>64</b> and 
            <b>65</b> to seat in a parallel relationship to the roof. The rods extend outwardly of posts
            
            <b>21</b> and 
            <b>22</b>. That is, the distance between post 
            <b>21</b> and 
            <b>22</b> is less than the distance between outer ends 
            <b>64</b> and 
            <b>65</b>. Rods 
            <b>61</b> and 
            <b>62</b> can be positioned at various angles thereby increasing the stability of standoff
            
            <b>20</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">The distal end 
            <b>49</b> of member 
            <b>31</b> is connected to the horizontal wall of the L-shaped member 
            <b>23</b>. A conventional bolt/nut combination 
            <b>71</b> connects member 
            <b>23</b> of support 
            <b>20</b> to the horizontal member 
            <b>31</b> of the ladder jack. The shank of the bolt extends through slot 
            <b>45</b> while wall 
            <b>44</b> (figref[FIG. 2]
            	) is positioned outward of member 
            <b>23</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to utilize our new standoff, posts 
            <b>21</b> and 
            <b>22</b> are adjusted with respect to member 
            <b>23</b> taking into account the slanted roof with the bottom end of each post resting atop
            the roof while member 
            <b>23</b> is horizontal. Supporting rods 
            <b>61</b> and 
            <b>62</b> are then adjusted to contact the roof outwardly of posts 
            <b>21</b> and 
            <b>22</b>. Further, the rods may be extended away from member 
            <b>23</b> thereby further increasing the stability of the support. The ladder jack prior to
            positioning rods 
            <b>61</b> and 
            <b>62</b> has been assembled with respect to member 
            <b>23</b> with fastener 
            <b>71</b> being in a loosened state to allow fastener 
            <b>71</b> to be adjusted along the length of slot 
            <b>45</b> taking into account the positioning of the ladder having its rungs mounted to the
            downwardly opening C-shaped walls 
            <b>34</b> and 
            <b>35</b>. Once the ladder extends upwardly at an appropriate angle to allow the worker to
            climb the ladder, fastener 
            <b>71</b> is tightened enabling the worker to climb the ladder in a stable condition. Rods
            
            <b>61</b> and 
            <b>62</b> support the standoff on one side of the standoff whereas ladder 
            <b>40</b> being attached to the opposite end of the ladder jack supports the opposite side
            of the support. Further, supporting rods 
            <b>61</b> and 
            <b>62</b> increase the stability of the combination. Rods 
            <b>61</b> and 
            <b>62</b> as well as ladder 
            <b>40</b>, all being attached to the ladder jack, provide stability along the lengthwise extending
            axis 
            <b>70</b> (figref[FIG. 1]
            	) of member 
            <b>31</b>. Likewise, supporting rods 
            <b>61</b> and 
            <b>62</b> provide horizontal stability in a direction perpendicular to axis 
            <b>70</b>.

         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">The ladder standoff support allows the ladder, ladder jack and platform atop the ladder
            jack to be spaced apart from the roof by positioning the stabilizing rods atop the
            roof in a position so that the mounting member 
            <b>23</b> is located adjacent the edge of the roof thereby positioning the ladder, ladder jack
            and platform to the side of the roof. The invention disclosed herein is particularly
            useful in spacing a platform upon which the work stands apart from the roof. In such
            a case, two ladders each with a separate ladder jack mounted thereto are position
            to the side of the roof with the opposite ends of the platform resting atop and being
            supported by the two ladder jacks. Each ladder jack is provided with a ladder standoff
            support thereby maintaining the two ladders with ladder jacks and platform apart from
            and to the side of the roof.

         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">Many variations in the present invention are contemplated and included. For example,
            the distal ends of the stabilizing rods are arranged at an obtuse angle with respect
            to the straight main bodies of the rods although angles other than obtuse are included.
            Typically the outer rods
