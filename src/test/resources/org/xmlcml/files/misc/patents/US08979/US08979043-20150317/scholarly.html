         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Application</p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure is directed to the mounting of lighting, among other devices, and
            more specifically to brackets used for mounting outdoor solar lighting devices on
            various types of surfaces, including but not limited to block walls, chain link fences,
            wooden fences and flat walls or holding outdoor solar lighting devices as stand-alone
            fixtures.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Disclosure</p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Outdoor lighting is not only useful for illuminating a home, but also for adding security
            and beauty. Exterior lighting is available in low-voltage, solar models that are both
            attractive and easy to install. Solar lighting is environmentally friendly and nearly
            cost-free to operate. Solar-powered models absorb energy from sunlight, convert it
            into electrical energy, and store it in rechargeable solar batteries. At dusk, a small
            photo-cell fixture turns the lights on. The lights remain illuminated for a specific
            amount of time, until the batteries run out of charge or the sensor detects sufficient
            daylight to turn them off. When the sun comes up, the batteries are recharged. Thus,
            solar lighting must be placed in an area that allows the built-in solar panel to collect
            and convert sunlight into electric power, while the pre-installed rechargeable battery
            stores the energy to power the light at night.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">Stand-alone, outdoor solar lights are generally installed using holding posts for
            insertion into the ground, for example along an outdoor walking path or around an
            outdoor patio area. These commercially-available holding posts can have a diameter
            that is variable, but typically is about one inch and a quarter or less and they can
            be up to many feet in length, depending on how high off the ground someone may want
            the solar light. However, typically the holding posts are around one to two feet in
            length. One end of the holding post may be fitted with an adapter for attaching the
            solar light (e.g., possibly something similar to a camera tripod attachment for a
            camera) and the other end of the holding post is usually pointed to facility an easier
            insertion into the ground.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">As can be seen, the solar lights with holding posts are limited to being installed
            by inserting them into the ground. However, this installation method is not always
            desired or desirable, and is even impossible in some situations. Therefore, what is
            needed is a bracket or fixture that facilitates installation of the outdoor, solar
            lights (with or without the holding posts) in a multitude of locations, including
            stand-alone uses.
