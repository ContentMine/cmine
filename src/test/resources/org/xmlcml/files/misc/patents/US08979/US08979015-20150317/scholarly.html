      <p>A tail assembly (
         <b>10</b>) for a rotorcraft (
         <b>20</b>), the tail assembly (
         <b>10</b>) comprising a first stabilizer (
         <b>3</b>) extending transversely on either side of an anteroposterior plane (P
         <b>1</b>), and a second stabilizer (
         <b>4, 4</b>″) extending in elevation. Two propellers (
         <b>31, 41</b>) positioned on either side of the anteroposterior plane (P
         <b>1</b>) provide the rotorcraft (
         <b>20</b>) with at least part of its yaw control and its propulsion. The axes of the two propellers
         (
         <b>31, 41</b>) are situated in a plane substantially parallel to the horizontal plane (P
         <b>3</b>) and they intersect at a position in the anteroposterior plane (P
         <b>1</b>) of the rotorcraft (
         <b>20</b>) that is located between the front end of the rotorcraft (
         <b>20</b>) and the propellers (
         <b>31, 41</b>). Using both propellers (
         <b>31, 41</b>) of the tail assembly (
         <b>10</b>) simultaneously makes it possible to provide the rotorcraft (
         <b>20</b>) with longitudinal thrust while conserving its transverse thrust for the anti-torque
         function, it being possible to control these two thrusts independently.

         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the field of rotorcraft tail rotors. The present
            invention relates to an anti-torque device with longitudinal thrust for a rotorcraft.
            The invention also provides a rotorcraft fitted with such a device. Furthermore, the
            device is also usable on a drone, i.e. an aircraft not having a human pilot on board.
            This type of aircraft, generally of size that is small compared with traditional helicopters,
            is for use in missions of surveillance, information, or combat type.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">More particularly, the invention relates to a helicopter having a long range and a
            high forward speed in cruising flight.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">(2) Description of Related Art</p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">A helicopter generally has a single main rotor with a plurality of blades driven mechanically
            by at least one turbine engine, e.g. the main rotor providing the aircraft with both
            lift and with propulsion.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">A helicopter is traditionally provided with a secondary rotor positioned at the rear
            end of the aircraft, the secondary rotor providing an anti-torque function in order
            to compensate for the yaw torque that is created by the rotation of the main rotor,
            the secondary rotor exerting an opposing transverse thrust. Consequently, such a secondary
            rotor is referred to as a “tail” rotor or an “anti-torque” rotor by the person skilled
            in the art. The term tail rotor is used below for convenience.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, the tail rotor has a propeller with a plurality of blades, it being possible
            to modify the pitch of those blades collectively, i.e. to vary the pitch of all of
            the blades in identical manner. A pilot can thus control yaw and turning movements
            of the helicopter by modifying the pitch of the blades in the tail rotor so as to
            modify the magnitude and the direction of the transverse thrust.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">The tail rotor is mounted laterally on one end of the helicopter tail boom, or else
            on a top end of a vertical fin carried by said tail boom.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">When installed on a helicopter, the present invention uses longitudinal thrust, making
            it possible to obtain long range and high forward speed in cruising flight.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such helicopters relating to an advanced concept of a vertical take-off and landing
            (VTOL) aircraft are referred to by the person skilled in the art as “hybrid” helicopters.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">From the various studies on hybrid helicopters that have already been performed, such
            an aircraft may comprise the following main elements:
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">an airframe;</p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">a lift surface secured to the airframe;</p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">stabilization and maneuvering surfaces, namely: in the pitching direction: a horizontal
            stabilizer with at least one pitching control surface that is movable relative to
            its front portion or “horizontal plane”; in the yaw direction, at least one suitable
            stabilizer;
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">at least one main rotor with the blades of the main rotor having both collective and
            cyclic pitch control;
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">at least one propulsive propeller with the blades of the propeller having collective
            pitch control; and
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">at least one turbine engine driving the main rotor and the propulsive propeller via
            a mechanical power transmission.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">A first study undertaken by Lockheed® in the context of the Cheyenne® program differs
            from a conventional helicopter by the presence of two wings of small dimensions in
            addition to the main rotor and the tail rotor, which wings are for providing lift
            when flying at high speed, and also a third rotor having three blades that is situated
            at the end of the tail boom of the aircraft perpendicularly to the conventional tail
            rotor. The function of the third rotor is to propel the aircraft forwards at high
            speed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">Subsequently, an experimental Piasecki® SpeedHawk® helicopter has made use of a main
            rotor having four blades and two short wings on either side of the airframe, the conventional
            tail rotor being replaced by a ducted tail rotor. The ducted tail rotor performs both
            the anti-torque function and a longitudinal thrust function by using vectored thrust
            ducted propeller technology.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">A recent study concerning a Sikorsky® X2® aircraft has two main rotors, each with
            four blades that are superposed above the airframe and that are contrarotating, i.e.
            they rotate in opposite directions to each other. That technique serves to cancel
            the turning effect on the airframe generated by a single main rotor and thus makes
            it possible to eliminate the tail rotor that is conventionally used for opposing yaw
            torque. However, the aircraft has a third rotor located at the rear end of the airframe
            perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft in order to add longitudinal
            thrust.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0022">Because of the presence of a lift portion on either side of the airframe for generating
            lift in cruising flight, the main rotors can deliver less lift under such conditions,
            thereby limiting the vibration produced with conventional main rotors. In contrast,
            the main rotors provide all of the lift of the hybrid helicopter during stages of
            take-off, landing, and vertical flight.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">A recent study undertaken by Eurocopter® presents a different architecture. According
            to patent FR 2 916 418, the aircraft has a main rotor with five blades and two propellers
            installed on either side of the airframe of the aircraft on wings of small span. Those
            two propellers provide the longitudinal thrust needed to enable the helicopter to
            advance at high speed. In that configuration also, the tail rotor is omitted and the
            turning effect generated by the main rotor is compensated by the two side propellers,
            by acting on their respective thrusts.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">Once more, the lift from the main rotor can be reduced above a certain longitudinal
            speed at which the lift portion provides sufficient additional lift, thereby making
            it possible to limit the amount of vibration generated in comparison with conventional
            main rotors.

         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also known from document JP 2009/051465 is a tail rotor system made up of two ducted
            propellers located on either side of a vertical stabilizer. The axes of the two propellers
            form a V-shape in a horizontal plane, with the tip of the V-shape pointing rearwards
            relative to the aircraft so that the axes of the two propellers splay apart from the
            tail boom of the helicopter on going towards the front of the aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">The air streams generated by the two propellers act via the vertical stabilizer to
            oppose the turning effect generated by the main rotor and they also enable the aircraft
            to be controlled in yaw. Furthermore, those air streams provide longitudinal thrust
            for propelling cruising flight of the aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">The function of the vertical stabilizer is to stabilize the aircraft by channeling
            and steering the air streams generated by the propellers, both during hovering flight
            and during cruising flight. A rudder on the rear portion of the vertical stabilizer
            serves to accentuate this steering of the streams, e.g. in order to perform yaw maneuvers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the same manner, a horizontal stabilizer enables the aircraft to be stabilized
            and controlled in pitching. The vertical stabilizer between the two rotors also serves
            to avoid air stream turbulences between propellers by isolating the air streams from
            each of the propellers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">In contrast, steering the air streams in this way involves a significant loss of aerodynamic
            efficiency, in particular as a result of friction between the air streams and the

         <h1>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0034" num="0033">An object of the present invention is thus to propose an alternative solution for
            providing hybrid helicopters.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the invention, a tail assembly of a rotorcraft comprises a tail boom
            and two propellers providing at least part of the yaw control and the propulsion of
            the rotorcraft, a first propeller being provided with at least two first blades driven
            in rotation about a first axis and a second propeller being provided with at least
            two second blades driven in rotation about a second axis.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0036" num="0035">Firstly, it is possible in this tail assembly to define three axes defining a rectangular
            coordinate system: a longitudinal axis extending from the front end of the tail boom
            towards the rear end; a transverse axis extending from right to left; and an elevation
            axis extending upwards.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0037" num="0036">An anteroposterior plane for the tail assembly can then be defined. This plane extends
            from the front end of the tail boom towards the rear end, and is formed by the above-defined
            longitudinal axis and elevation axis. In principle this anteroposterior plane is vertical
            when the rotorcraft on which the tail assembly is installed is standing on the ground.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0038" num="0037">A second plane, referred to for convenience as the “horizontal plane” is perpendicular
            to the elevation axis of said tail assembly and contains the center of gravity of
            said assembly. As a result, this horizontal plane is perpendicular to the above-defined
            anteroposterior plane and contains the transverse axis and the longitudinal axis.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first and second propellers of the tail assembly are identical and they are positioned
            on either side of the anteroposterior plane.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0040" num="0039">As a result, the first axis of rotation of the first propeller and the second axis
            of rotation of the second propeller are not parallel and they do not coincide, but
            rather they present a point of intersection positioned in the anteroposterior plane
            of the tail assembly, between the front end of the tail boom and the first and second
            propellers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0041" num="0040">The assembly is remarkable in that using the first and second propellers simultaneously
            makes it possible to provide longitudinal thrust while conserving transverse thrust
            for the anti-torque function, with it being possible for these two thrusts to be controlled
            independently.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">Since the first and second axes of rotation of the first and second propellers intersect,
            and since the first and second propellers are positioned on either side of the anteroposterior
            plane, the axis of each propeller cannot be perpendicular to the longitudinal axis
            of the tail assembly as for a conventional tail rotor. Each axis is therefore inclined
            relative to the longitudinal axis of the tail assembly and the intersection of the
            first and second axes of rotation of the first and second propellers is located in
            front of said propellers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0043" num="0042">Consequently, the air streams generated by each of the propellers diverge, in particular
            when used for providing longitudinal thrust, i.e. during flights at cruising speed.
            As a result, these air streams move apart from each other, thereby making it possible
            to reduce significantly the disturbances that might be created between the first and
            second propellers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, since the force generated by each propeller is inclined relative to the
            longitudinal axis of the tail assembly, it can be resolved into a transverse component
            and into a longitudinal component.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0045" num="0044">The longitudinal components of the first and second propellers can then be combined
            to form the longitudinal thrust of the tail assembly, which thrust is added to the
            propulsion effect of the main rotor of the rotorcraft and enables the rotorcraft to
            obtain high forward speeds.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0046" num="0045">In order to obtain maximum longitudinal thrust, the longitudinal component of each
            propeller must be maximized. For this purpose, the plane of the propeller axes as
            constituted by the first and second axes of rotation of the first and second propellers
            then needs to contain or be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tail assembly,
            with the respective longitudinal components of the first and second propellers both
            being directed in the same direction.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0047" num="0046">Similarly, in order to maximize transverse thrust, the transverse component of each
            propeller must be maximized. For this purpose, the plane of the propeller axes must
            then contain or be parallel to the transverse axis of the tail assembly, with the
            respective transverse components of the first and second propellers being directed
            in the same direction.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0048" num="0047">Consequently, in order to define an architecture that makes it possible to obtain
            maximum transverse thrust and maximum longitudinal thrust, the plane of the propeller
            axes must contain or be parallel to both the transverse axis and the longitudinal
            axis of the tail assembly, i.e. said plane must coincide with or be parallel to the
            horizontal plane of the tail assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a variant of the invention, the plane of the propeller axes is substantially parallel
            to the horizontal plane of the tail assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0050" num="0049">The transverse thrust of the tail assembly, which is a combination of the transverse
            components of the first and second propellers, also constitutes the anti-torque force
            that opposes the turning effect of the main rotor of the rotorcraft. Since this force
            is obtained from two propellers, the dimensions of the blades forming the propellers
            can be reduced compared with a conventional tail rotor, while still being capable
            of achieving an equivalent anti-torque force. In addition, since the anti-torque force
            from the assembly is equivalent to that from a traditional tail rotor, the lever arm
            of the anti-torque force, which lever arm corresponds to the distance between the
            center of gravity of the rotorcraft and the propellers of the tail assembly, then
            remains unchanged compared with that of a traditional rotorcraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0051" num="0050">In general, the magnitude of the thrust from a propeller can be modified by acting
            on the pitch of the blades of said propeller.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, by modifying the respective blade pitches of each of the propellers in different
            ways, it is possible to vary their respective thrust. As a result, the direction of
            the resultant of the thrust from the first and second propellers can be modified,
            as can its magnitude.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is then possible to modify the transverse thrust from the tail assembly of the
            invention independently of its longitudinal thrust by appropriately modifying the
            blade pitch of each propeller.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0054" num="0053">The tail assembly of the invention may also include one or more additional characteristics.</p>
         <p id="p-0055" num="0054">The tail assembly is for use in particular on hybrid helicopters. Helicopters of this
            type generally have lift surfaces on either side of the airframe that serve to create
            additional lift in cruising flight, and they also have tail stabilizers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an embodiment of the invention, the tail assembly has a first stabilizer extending
            transversely on either side of the above-defined anteroposterior plane, and in principle
            substantially horizontally, but possibly presenting angles relative to said anteroposterior
            plane, and also has a second stabilizer extending in elevation, and in principle vertically.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0057" num="0056">For simplification purposes, the description below refers to the “transverse” stabilizer
            and to the stabilizer “in elevation”.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is specified that each stabilizer may comprise one or more airfoils. Each stabilizer
            may also be symmetrical about the anteroposterior plane or it may be asymmetrical
            about this plane. For example, the stabilizer in elevation may be constituted by two
            airfoils located on either side of the anteroposterior plane and arranged at respective
            outer ends of the transverse stabilizer.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0059" num="0058">The anti-torque function opposing the turning effect of the main rotor can then be
            provided in various ways.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0060" num="0059">At low or zero forward speeds, the anti-torque function is provided solely by the
            transverse force generated by each propeller of the tail assembly, which forces are
            added together, the tail assembly providing this transverse thrust only.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0061" num="0060">At cruising speeds, the shape of the second stabilizer that extends in elevation is
            designed, under the effect of aerodynamic forces, to create an anti-torque transverse
            force that is capable of opposing the turning effect of the main rotor of the rotorcraft
            in full or in part. Under such circumstances, most or all of the thrust generated
            by the first and second propellers can be used solely for propelling the rotorcraft
            in order to improve its performance.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore, when lift surfaces are also present, additional lift is generated, mainly
            at cruising speed. The lift generated by the main rotor of the rotorcraft can then
            be reduced, either by modifying the angle of incidence of the blades of the main rotor,
            or by reducing the speed of rotation of the main rotor. Either way, the turning effect
            of the main rotor is reduced, and consequently the anti-torque force that needs to
            be generated by the tail assembly is also reduced. Once more, most or all of the thrust
            generated by the first and second propellers can be used solely for propelling the
            rotorcraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0063" num="0062">When flying at moderate forward speeds, i.e. speeds of the same order as the speed
            of a conventional rotorcraft, the lift generated by the lift surfaces is not sufficient
            to reduce the lift from the main rotor of the rotorcraft, so the turning effect of
            the main rotor therefore remains large. Nevertheless, at such speeds, a transverse
            force can be created by the stabilizer that extends in elevation, with this force
            then contributing part of the anti-torque function. The additional transverse force
            needed to oppose the turning effect of the main rotor in full is provided by the first
            and second propellers of the tail assembly, with their transverse components being
            combined. Under such circumstances, the tail assembly can provide some longitudinal
            thrust for contributing to propulsion of the rotorcraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0064" num="0063">Consequently, the use of lift surfaces and of stabilizers enables the use of the main
            rotor of the rotorcraft to be optimized as a function of its forward speed and enables
            maximum use to be made of the tail assembly for propelling the rotorcraft. This serves
            to optimize the performance of the rotorcraft in terms of speed and range.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, in an aspect of the invention, the second stabilizer in elevation does
            not have any moving parts. Yaw maneuvers and turns are controlled by acting on the
            transverse thrust from the tail assembly and on the direction in which the lift acts
            from the main rotor of the rotorcraft, with the contribution of the stabilizer to
            the transverse force being restricted to the anti-torque function and associated solely
            with the longitudinal speed of the rotorcraft. Manufacture of this stabilizer without
            moving parts thus remains simple.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0066" num="0065">In contrast, the transverse first stabilizer may include moving parts or be movable
            as a whole in order to modify the lift of said stabilizer. This modification of lift
            is needed essentially for maneuvering the rotorcraft in cruising flight.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0067" num="0066">The first and second stabilizers are positioned ahead of the first and second propellers,
            i.e. between the front end of the tail assembly and the first and second propellers,
            with this providing several advantages.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0068" num="0067">Firstly, the air streams flowing over the first and second stabilizers are disturbed
            little by the rotation of the first and second propellers. The efficiency of the first
            and second stabilizers of the tail assembly is optimized by limiting the effects of
            drag.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, with the first and second stabilizers located between the first and second
            propellers and the front end of the tail assembly, occupants entering or leaving the
            airframe of the rotorcraft, which airframe is situated in front of the tail assembly,
            are protected from the first and second propellers of the tail assembly by the first
            and second stabilizers, which stabilizers thus provide protection. Access to the inside
            of the rotorcraft is thus made safer with respect with the propulsive propellers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0070" num="0069">Finally, in the event of the propellers being impacted in flight by external elements,
            e.g. a bird, since the first and second propellers are positioned at the rear end
            of the tail assembly, none of its structural parts, such as a stabilizer, will be
            damaged by the zone in which the propeller breaks up.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0071" num="0070">In another embodiment of the invention, the first axis of rotation of the first propeller
            is at an angle of 90° relative to the second axis of rotation of the second propeller.
            In addition, the first and second axes of rotation are positioned symmetrically about
            the anteroposterior plane of the tail assembly. This architecture serves to obtain
            equilibrium between the longitudinal and transverse thrusts from each of the propellers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0072" num="0071">Each axis then forms an angle of 45° with the longitudinal axis of the tail assembly.
            As a result, the magnitude of the longitudinal thrust generated by each of the propellers
            is always equal to the magnitude of the transverse thrust from that propeller. The
            respective thrusts from each of the propellers are then geometrically simple to combine
            in order to obtain the resultant thrust on the tail assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0073" num="0072">In particular, when the first propeller delivers thrust directed forwards and the
            second propeller delivers thrust of the same magnitude directed rearwards, then it
            is possible to obtain a resultant thrust that is transverse only, i.e. that does not
            include any longitudinal thrust, e.g. while hovering.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0074" num="0073">Similarly, when the first and second propellers both deliver thrust of the same magnitude
            directed rearwards, it is possible to obtain a resultant thrust that is longitudinal
            only, i.e. without any transverse thrust, e.g. for cruising flight.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0075" num="0074">However, it is possible to select a different architecture. If forward speed and power
            are given precedence over the anti-torque function of the tail assembly, then the
            angle defined between the first and second axes of rotation should be less than 90°.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0076" num="0075">In contrast, in order to give the anti-torque function precedence over speed, then
            the angle between the axes of rotation of the two propellers should be greater than
            90°.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0077" num="0076">In another embodiment of the invention, the first and second propellers of the tail
            assembly are driven in rotation by a common tail power transmission gearbox. Conventionally,
            the propeller constituting the tail rotor is driven in rotation by at least one main
            engine (also driving the main rotor of the rotorcraft) via a transmission shaft extending
            along the tail boom of the rotorcraft and via a tail gearbox. That tail gearbox serves
            to transmit the rotary motion from the main engine while providing transmission at
            an angle of about 90° as conventionally exists between the drive shaft and the propeller
            axis of the tail rotor. In the particular context of hybrid helicopters having two
            propulsive propellers, it is often not possible to use a single gearbox, since the
            two propellers are too far apart. It is then necessary to use two gearboxes, thereby
            presenting several drawbacks, such as increased cost and weight of the rotorcraft
            and possibly also a loss of efficiency in the mechanical transmission of power.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0078" num="0077">The architecture of the tail assembly of the invention thus makes it possible to use
            a single tail gearbox to drive both the first and the second propellers, the propellers
            being located near to each other on the tail boom. This makes it possible to reduce
            the costs and the weight of the mechanical power transmission in the tail assembly
            of the invention.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0079" num="0078">Furthermore, depending on how the gearbox is built, the first and second propellers
            may rotate in the same direction or they may rotate in opposite directions, in which
            case they are said to be contrarotating propellers. Under such circumstances, the
            respective torques from each of the propellers are in opposition, thereby providing
            a tail assembly that is balanced.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0080" num="0079">Finally, using a single tail gearbox guarantees that the first and second propellers
            are synchronized, and when this is combined with the fact that they are contrarotating,
            it enables two meshing propellers to be used for providing the tail assembly of the
            invention. This procures an additional advantage in that the volume of the tail assembly
            can be reduced when the first and second propellers are both contrarotating and meshing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0081" num="0080">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the tail assembly includes a rocker that
            acts on the respective blade pitches of each of the propellers. In this preferred
            embodiment, the first and second axes of rotation of the first and second propellers
            are positioned symmetrically about the anteroposterior plane of the tail assembly.
            The rocker, which is associated with the blade pitch of each of the propellers, needs
            to have at least two degrees of freedom. It thus makes it possible to ensure that
            the variations of those pitches are at a predetermined ratio and consequently to ensure
            that the thrusts generated by the first and second propellers are at a pre-determined
            ratio. Consequently, the shape and the movements of the rocker enable the thrusts
            of each of the propellers to be combined in predetermined manner and consequently
            enables the transverse and longitudinal thrusts of the tail assembly to be combined
            in predetermined manner.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0082" num="0081">Furthermore, in order to obtain behavior that is identical to that of a conventional
            tail rotor, the rocker should be defined so that when it is in its neutral position,
            i.e. when the pilot of the rotorcraft is not actuating any control, the resulting
            longitudinal thrust from the first and second propellers is zero. The tail assembly
            then produces a resultant thrust that is transverse only, in opposition to the turning
            effect of the main rotor of the rotorcraft. For this purpose, a first one of the propellers
            needs to have its thrust directed forwards and the other or second propeller needs
            to have its thrust directed rearwards, with the magnitude of the thrust from each
            of the propellers being identical, and with the propeller that is selected to be the
            “first” propeller being a function of the direction in which the anti-torque force
            is to be generated.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0083" num="0082">This initial position in which the longitudinal thrust from the tail assembly is zero
            can act as a reference position in order to define the direction in which thrust from
            each propeller is varied and the direction in which the blade pitch of each propeller
            is varied. It can thus be defined that an increase in the pitch of the blades of one
            propeller increases its longitudinal thrust towards the rear of the tail assembly,
            a reduction of this pitch then lowering this rearward longitudinal thrust possibly
            to such an extent as to reverse the thrust direction, i.e. so as to obtain forward
            longitudinal thrust from the tail assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0084" num="0083">During a first movement of the rocker, the magnitude of the transverse resultant of
            the thrust from the first and second propellers is modified while the resultant longitudinal
            thrust is left unchanged. For this purpose, the variations in longitudinal thrust
            from each of the propellers must cancel. Since the thrust directions from each of
            the propellers are symmetrical about the anteroposterior plane of the tail assembly,
            it then suffices for the variations in the magnitudes of these thrusts to be identical,
            one directed forwards and the other rearwards. Since variation in the magnitude of
            the thrust from a propeller is proportional to variation in its pitch, it therefore
            suffices for the pitches of the blades of each of the propellers to vary through opposite
            values, assuming that the two propellers are identical.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0085" num="0084">The first movement of the rocker must therefore give rise to simultaneous opposite
            variations in the blade pitches of the propellers so as to vary the transverse thrust
            from the tail assembly of the invention while the resultant longitudinal thrust remains
            constant.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0086" num="0085">In a second movement of the rocker, the magnitude of the longitudinal resultant of
            the thrust from the first and second propellers is modified while the resulting transverse
            thrust remains unchanged. For this purpose, the variations in the transverse thrust
            from each of the propellers must cancel. In the same manner as above, it can be deduced
            that it suffices for the variations in the magnitudes of the thrust to be identical,
            and in the same direction.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0087" num="0086">The second movement of the rocker must therefore give rise to simultaneous identical
            variation in the blade pitch of each of the propellers so as to obtain variation in
            the longitudinal thrust from the tail assembly of the invention, while the resulting
            transverse thrust remains constant.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0088" num="0087">The above-described operation should be understood as applying to first and second
            propellers that are completely identical in an environment that is not disturbed.
            In practice, the tail assembly is subjected to various aerodynamic disturbances, in
            particular as a result of the air streams generated by the main rotor, which may then
            have differing effects on the first and second propellers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0089" num="0088">The location of the rocker, its shape, and its movements may be defined so as to compensate
            for the effects of those aerodynamic disturbances and thus obtain a predetermined
            ratio between the pitch variations of the first and second propellers. This predetermined
            ratio may depend in particular on the architecture of the aircraft on which the tail
            assembly of the invention is installed, and it may also take account of any differences
            that might exist between the first and second propellers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0090" num="0089">Thus, the first movement of the rocker giving rise to simultaneous variations in opposite
            directions of the blade pitches of each of the propellers with a predetermined ratio
            makes it possible to obtain variation in the transverse thrust from the tail assembly
            of the invention while the resulting longitudinal thrust remains constant. Similarly,
            the second movement of the rocker giving rise to simultaneous variations in the same
            direction of the blade pitches of each of the propellers at the predetermined ratio
            then serves to obtain variation in the longitudinal thrust from the tail assembly
            while the resulting transverse thrust remains constant.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0091" num="0090">Consequently, the rocker enables the transverse and longitudinal thrusts from the
            tail assembly to be controlled independently. A rotorcraft fitted with such an assembly
            can then perform yaw or turning maneuvers without modifying the forward speed of the
            aircraft or the power delivered for said forward speed while the rocker is performing
            its first movement. The rocker also makes it possible to increase or reduce the longitudinal
            thrust and thus the forward speed of the rotorcraft without any impact on the transverse
            thrust while it is performing its second movement. Naturally, it is possible to perform
            both movements of the rocker simultaneously, in which case the rotorcraft performs
            a yaw maneuver while simultaneously modifying its longitudinal thrust.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0092" num="0091">The invention remains simple to use in spite of the first and second propellers delivering
            thrust in different directions. Maneuvering a rotorcraft fitted with a tail assembly
            of the invention remains identical to maneuvering a conventional rotorcraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0093" num="0092">The longitudinal thrust control is an additional control that can be added simply
            without impacting the conventional flight controls and with no direct effect on the
            direction of a rotorcraft fitted with a tail assembly of the invention.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0094" num="0093">In a particular embodiment, the first movement of the rocker is a movement in rotation
            while the second movement of the rocker is a movement in translation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0095" num="0094">The axis for translation movement of the rocker lies in the anteroposterior plane
            of the tail assembly, i.e. the plane about which the first and second axes of the
            first and second propellers are arranged symmetrically. The axis of rotation of the
            rocker also lies in said anteroposterior plane and extends in the elevation direction
            of the tail assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0096" num="0095">The first movement of the rocker is a movement in rotation that gives rise to a modification
            of the blade pitch of each of the propellers so as to obtain solely a variation in
            the transverse thrust from the tail assembly. The second movement of the rocker is
            a movement in translation that gives rise to a modification of the blade pitch of
            each of the propellers so as to obtain solely a variation in the longitudinal thrust
            from the tail assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0097" num="0096">In a variant of the invention, the movement in translation of the rocker that varies
            the longitudinal thrust of the tail assembly may be obtained by means of at least
            one first electric motor. Since the longitudinal thrust function does not exist on
            conventional rotorcraft, it is necessary to add an additional control in the cockpit
            of the rotorcraft. This additional control is simple to install if an electric motor
            is used, as contrasted with a mechanical control. Furthermore, since electric flight
            controls are becoming ever more common, it is advantageous for this new function to
            be electrically controlled.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0098" num="0097">In another variant of the invention, the rotary movement of the rocker that varies
            the transverse thrust of the tail assembly may be obtained by means of at least one
            second electric motor. This transverse thrust function that is used in particular
            for controlling yaw maneuvers already exists on conventional rotorcraft. The mechanical
            controls for performing this function on traditional rotorcraft may be adapted for
            controlling the tail assembly of the invention. However, it is also advantageous to
            take account of electric flight controls that are becoming more common, which justifies
            the possibility of using an electric motor.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0099" num="0098">In another embodiment, the first and second propellers of the tail assembly of the
            invention are ducted in fairings that serve essentially to protect the environment
            outside the rotary elements constituting the first and second propellers, and also
            to protect the propellers from the outside environment.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0100" num="0099">People moving in the vicinity of the rotorcraft are thus protected from the rotary
            blades of the first and second propellers of the tail assembly by the fairings. Similarly,
            each propeller is protected from any external elements that might penetrate into the
            perimeter of blade rotation and damage the blades.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0101" num="0100">However, the advantages that are normally to be found with a fairing do not necessarily
            arise, in particular in terms of aerodynamics, since the propellers of the tail assembly
            are not parallel to the longitudinal axis.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0102" num="0101">In another embodiment, the plane of the propeller axes as defined by the first and
            second axes of the first and second propellers is inclined in order to compensate
            for the weight of the tail assembly of the invention. In spite of using a common tail
            gearbox for both propellers, using two propellers nevertheless increases the weight
            of the tail assembly and thus the weight at the end of the tail boom of the rotorcraft.
            In order to compensate for the impact of this additional weight, it is possible for
            the first and second propellers to be directed a little in such a manner that a vertical
            component of the thrust that results from the first and second propellers counters
            the weight of the tail assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0103" num="0102">At least two variants are possible for this compensation of the weight of the tail
            assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0104" num="0103">Firstly, the plane of the propeller axes may be inclined about the longitudinal axis
            of the tail assembly. This variant uses a fraction of the transverse component of
            the thrust that results from the first and second propellers in order to compensate
            for the weight of the tail assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0105" num="0104">In another variant, the plane of the propeller axes is inclined about the transverse
            axis of the tail assembly. This variant uses a portion of the longitudinal component
            of the resultant thrust from the first and second propellers to compensate for the
            weight of the tail assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0106" num="0105">In addition, at high forward speeds, the horizontally extending first stabilizer can
            also be designed to generate a lift force for compensating the weight of the tail
            assembly in full or in part.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0107" num="0106">The present invention also provides a rotorcraft including the above-described tail
            assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0108" num="0107">Firstly, a rotorcraft has three axes that are equivalent and parallel to the axes
            defined for the tail assembly, i.e. a longitudinal axis extending from the front tip
            of the airframe to the rear end of the tail boom of said rotorcraft, a transverse
            axis extending from right to left, and an elevation axis extending upwards.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0109" num="0108">Similarly, an anteroposterior plane of the rotorcraft can be defined. This plane extends
            from the front to the rear of the rotorcraft and is formed by its longitudinal axis
            and its elevation axis as defined above, and it generally coincides with the anteroposterior
            plane of the tail assembly. A second plane that is referred to for convenience as
            the “horizontal plane of the rotorcraft” is perpendicular to the elevation axis of
            the rotorcraft and contains the center of gravity of the rotorcraft. As a result,
            this plane is parallel to the horizontal plane of the tail assembly and contains the
            transverse axis of the rotorcraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0110" num="0109">A conventional rotorcraft has at least one main rotor, an airframe, an engine, a rear
            structure provided with a tail boom, and a tail rotor for providing yaw control of
            the rotorcraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0111" num="0110">Said rear structure may then be physically replaced by a tail assembly of the invention,
            in particular because the lever arm relative to the center of gravity of the rotorcraft
            is identical for the anti-torque force from a conventional tail rotor and for the
            anti-torque force from a tail assembly of the invention.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0112" num="0111">In a variant of the invention, a lift surface extending transversely on either side
            of the airframe and provided with at least two control surfaces may be added to the
            rotorcraft. This obtains the advantages associated with using a lift surface, in particular
            in terms of improving the performance of the rotorcraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0113" num="0112">In another embodiment of the invention, a rotorcraft may be defined to be capable
            of using either a rear structure having a conventional tail rotor, or a tail assembly
            of the invention.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0114" num="0113">Under such circumstances, the rear structure and the tail assembly are interchangeable.
            This transformation is made possible because of the particular features of the invention,
            including amongst others the lever arm relative to the center of gravity of the aircraft
            that is identical for the anti-torque force from the rear structure provided with
            a conventional tail rotor and from the tail assembly of the invention.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0115" num="0114">In addition, since the flight controls for performing yaw maneuvers are identical
            for both types of rotorcraft, only the longitudinal thrust control differs and needs
            to be taken into account when modifying the rotorcraft. This control then operates
            on the longitudinal thrust when using the tail assembly of the invention and has no
            effect when using the rear assembly having a traditional tail rotor.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0116" num="0115">Finally, the possibility of using electric motors for controlling the rocker and consequently
            for controlling blade pitch variations of the propellers in the tail assembly serves
            to simplify this transformation by limiting the number of mechanical controls between
            the airframe and the tail assembly of the rotorcraft. In the particular circumstance
            of using electric motors for controlling both of the movements of the rocker for controlling
            the blade pitches of the propellers of the tail assembly, only the connection of the
            shaft transmitting rotation to the propellers of the tail assembly from the power
            plant present in the rotorcraft needs to be implemented mechanically. Thereafter,
            since the other controls are electrical, assembling the tail assembly on the airframe
            is simplified.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0117" num="0116">In a variant, the lift surface that extends transversely on either side of the airframe
            and that is provided with at least two control surfaces may also be added to a rotorcraft
            fitted with a tail assembly of the invention, thus making it possible to achieve a
            greater range and a higher forward speed in cruising flight.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0126" num="0125">Firstly, it should be observed that three directions X, Y, and Z are shown in figref[FIGS. 1]
            	, 
            <b>3</b>, and 
            <b>7</b> and they form a rectangular coordinate system.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0127" num="0126">The first direction X is said to be longitudinal. It extends from front to rear, i.e.
            from the front tip of the helicopter airframe to the rear end of the tail boom of
            said helicopter. The term “longitudinal” relates to any direction parallel to the
            first direction X.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0128" num="0127">The second direction Y is said to be transverse. It extends from right to left. The
            term “transverse” relates to any direction parallel to the second direction Y.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0129" num="0128">Finally, the third direction Z is said to be in elevation. It extends upwards. The
            term “in elevation” relates to any direction parallel to the third direction Z.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0130" num="0129">It should also be observed that three particular planes P
            <b>1</b>, P
            <b>2</b>, and P
            <b>3</b> are shown in figref[FIGS. 1 and 3]
            	.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0131" num="0130">The first plane P
            <b>1</b> is an anteroposterior plane of the helicopter 
            <b>20</b>, extending from the front to the rear of said helicopter 
            <b>20</b>. It is made up of the directions X and Z (longitudinal and elevation directions).
            This anteroposterior plane is in principle vertical when the helicopter 
            <b>20</b> on which the tail assembly is installed is on the ground.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0132" num="0131">The second plane P
            <b>2</b> is perpendicular to the direction Z (the elevation direction) and contains the center
            of gravity of the helicopter 
            <b>20</b>. As a result, this plane P
            <b>2</b> is perpendicular to the anteroposterior plane P
            <b>1</b> as defined above and it contains the direction Y (the transverse direction). This
            plane P
            <b>2</b> corresponds to the “horizontal plane of the rotorcraft” as referred to above.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0133" num="0132">The third plane P
            <b>3</b>, referred to below for convenience as the “horizontal” plane is perpendicular to
            the direction Z (the elevation direction) and contains the center or gravity of the
            tail assembly 
            <b>10</b>. As a result, the plane P
            <b>3</b> is parallel to the plane P
            <b>2</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0134" num="0133">The plane P
            <b>1</b> is the anteroposterior plane both of the helicopter 
            <b>20</b> and of the tail assembly 
            <b>10</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0135" num="0134">figref[FIG. 1]
            	 shows a hybrid helicopter 
            <b>20</b> having a tail assembly 
            <b>10</b> of the invention. Such a helicopter 
            <b>20</b> comprises an airframe 
            <b>22</b>, a main rotor 
            <b>21</b> having a plurality of blades 
            <b>27</b>, and a lift surface 
            <b>23</b> extending transversely on either side of the airframe 
            <b>22</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0136" num="0135">The tail assembly 
            <b>10</b> has a tail boom 
            <b>28</b>, a first stabilizer 
            <b>3</b> that is substantially horizontal, extending transversely on either side of said anteroposterior
            plane P
            <b>1</b>, a second stabilizer made up of two airfoils 
            <b>4</b>′ and 
            <b>4</b>″ that are substantially vertical, extending in elevation on either side of the plane
            P
            <b>1</b>, a first propeller 
            <b>31</b>, and a second propeller 
            <b>41</b>. The first propeller 
            <b>31</b> has at least two first blades 
            <b>32</b> and is driven in rotation about a first axis 
            <b>35</b>, and the second propeller 
            <b>41</b> has at least two second blades 
            <b>42</b> and is driven in rotation about a second axis 
            <b>45</b>. The first blade 
            <b>31</b> and the second blade 
            <b>41</b> are positioned on either side of the anteroposterior plane P
            <b>1</b> and they are suitable for providing said helicopter 
            <b>20</b> with at least part of its yaw control and its propulsion.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0137" num="0136">The first and second propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b> are arranged in such a manner that the first and second axes of rotation 
            <b>35</b> and 
            <b>45</b> lie in a plane substantially parallel to the horizontal plane P
            <b>3</b> and intersect at a location in the anteroposterior plane P
            <b>1</b> between the front end of the tail boom 
            <b>28</b> of the helicopter 
            <b>20</b> and the first and second propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0138" num="0137">The first stabilizer 
            <b>3</b> may be movable or may contain one or more control surfaces in order to modify the
            lift of said stabilizer 
            <b>3</b>, while the second stabilizer 
            <b>4</b>′ and 
            <b>4</b>″ is stationary.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0139" num="0138">By using both the first and second propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b> simultaneously, the assembly 
            <b>10</b> serves to provide the helicopter 
            <b>20</b> with longitudinal thrust while also conserving transverse thrust for the anti-torque
            function, with it being possible to control these two thrusts independently.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0140" num="0139">The first axis of rotation 
            <b>35</b> and the second axis of rotation 
            <b>45</b> need not be perpendicular to the longitudinal direction X as in a conventional tail
            rotor. The first propeller 
            <b>31</b> and the second propeller 
            <b>41</b> are positioned on either side of the anteroposterior plane P
            <b>1</b>, and the first axis of rotation 
            <b>35</b> and the second axis of rotation 
            <b>45</b> intersect. Each of the axes 
            <b>35</b> and 
            <b>45</b> is inclined in a plane that is substantially parallel to the horizontal plane P
            <b>3</b>. As a result, the forces generated by each of the propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b>, which forces are parallel to the respective axes 
            <b>35</b> and 
            <b>45</b>, can be resolved into transverse components and longitudinal components.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0141" num="0140">The anti-torque force of the tail assembly 
            <b>10</b> of the invention that opposes the turning effect of the main rotor 
            <b>21</b>, is thus made up of the combination of the transverse components from the first and
            second propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b>. Furthermore, since the anti-torque force of this assembly is equivalent to that
            of a conventional helicopter 
            <b>50</b>, the lever arm between the center of gravity of the helicopter 
            <b>20</b> and the first and second propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b> remains unchanged compared with that of a conventional helicopter 
            <b>50</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0142" num="0141">The combined longitudinal components from the first and second propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b> constitutes the longitudinal thrust that is added to the propulsion effect from the
            main rotor 
            <b>21</b> of the helicopter 
            <b>20</b> and that enables high forward speeds to be obtained.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0143" num="0142">It can also be seen that the first and second propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b> are positioned behind the first and second stabilizers 
            <b>3</b>,

            <b>4</b>″ and the rear end of the helicopter 
            <b>20</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0144" num="0143">This particular architecture serves firstly to protect occupants entering or leaving
            the helicopter 
            <b>20</b> from the first and second propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b> by means of the first and second stabilizers 
            <b>3</b>, 
            <b>4</b>′, and 
            <b>4</b>″.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0145" num="0144">In addition, the first and second stabilizers 
            <b>3</b>, 
            <b>4</b>′, and 
            <b>4</b>″ are disturbed little from an aerodynamic point of view by the rotation of the first
            and second propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b>. The efficiency of the first and second stabilizers 
            <b>3</b>, 
            <b>4</b>′, and 
            <b>4</b>″ is optimized, in particular by limiting drag effects.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0146" num="0145">Finally, in the event of the first propeller 
            <b>31</b> or the second propeller 
            <b>41</b> impacting an external element in flight, the break-up damage zone situated generally
            at the impacted propeller is located at the rear end of the helicopter 
            <b>20</b> and no structural part such as the first stabilizer

            	, a tail power gearbox

         </p>
         <p id="p-0148" num="0147">In the particular context of hybrid helicopters using two propulsive propellers, it
            is sometimes not possible to use only one tail gearbox, since the two propellers are
            spaced apart too far from each other. It is then necessary to use two tail gearboxes,
            leading to several drawbacks, such as an increase in the cost and the weight of the
            helicopter, and possibly also to a decrease in the mechanical efficiency of the transmission
            line.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0149" num="0148">Since the first propeller 
            <b>31</b> and the second propeller

            <b>28</b> of the helicopter 
            <b>20</b>, it is possible to use a single gearbox 
            <b>6</b> for driving both the first and the second propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b>, thereby enabling the cost and the weight of the transmission in such a helicopter
            
            <b>20</b> to be reduced.

            the respective torques from the propellers 
            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b> oppose each other so as to provide a balanced tail assembly 
            <b>10</b>, and it is also possible to reduce the volume of the tail assembly 
            <b>10</b>, with the use of a single gearbox

            and transverse thrusts from each of the propellers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0153" num="0152">Since the axes

            <b>31</b> and

            <b>31</b> and 
            <b>41</b>. The thrusts from each of the propellers are then geometrically simple to combine
            in order to obtain the resultant thrust from the tail assembly

         <p id="p-0154" num="0153">However, it is possible to select a different architecture. If forward speed and power
            are to be given precedence over the anti-torque function of the tail assembly

            	, merely moving the rocker

            <b>32</b> and of the second blades 
            <b>42</b> in such a manner that the longitudinal thrust from each propeller is increased by
            the same value rearwards, i.e. the thrust F
            <b>1</b>′ from the first propeller which is directed forwards is reduced, while the thrust
            F
            <b>2</b>′ from the second propeller, which is directed rearwards, is increased by the same

            such circumstances, the lift from the main rotor

            <b>21</b>, or by reducing the speed of rotation of the main rotor 
            <b>21</b>. Either way, the turning effect of the main rotor 
            <b>21</b> is reduced. Once more, most or all of the thrust generated by the two propellers
            
            <b>31</b> and
