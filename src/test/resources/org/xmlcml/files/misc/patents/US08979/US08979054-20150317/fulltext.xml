<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wall mountable storage assembly including a storage device, at least one mounting plate, and at least one double-faced adhesive. The storage device includes a coupling bracket forming a first engagement feature. The mounting plate forms a second engagement feature. The first and second engagement features have a complimentary construction configured to provide a releasable snap fit connection in which the mounting plate can articulate relative to the coupling bracket. The adhesive is configured to be arranged between the mounting plate and a wall, with the mounting plate articulating relative to the coupling bracket to facilitate complete contact between the adhesive and the wall. The storage device can include two spaced-apart coupling brackets. Two of the mounting plates are provided, each carrying adhesive. The mounting plates can articulate independent of one another, accommodating variations in flatness of the wall to which the storage assembly is mounted.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to storage devices (e.g., caddies, shelves, etc.) that can be adhesively mounted to a wall. More particularly, it relates to wall mountable storage devices useful to hold a variety of items and adhesively mounted to various wall surfaces, including uneven and/or non-flat wall surfaces, such as a bath or shower enclosure wall.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Adhesives (e.g., pressure sensitive adhesives) have often found use in attaching articles to surfaces. For example, double-faced adhesive strips (i.e., strips bearing adhesive on both opposing major surfaces) are widely known and used. In particular, stretch-releasing adhesive strips and tapes have found use in a wide variety of assembly, joining, attaching, and mounting applications.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One such exemplary use of double-faced adhesives is to hold or mount a storage device (e.g., shelves, containers, baskets, caddies, etc.) to a wall. For example, shower and bath storage devices, often referred to as a shower or bath caddy, are commonly used to hold and/or store items such as soap, shampoo, and other bath items in shower and bath enclosures. Because of the weight of the stored items and because it is generally not practical to mount such items to the shower or bath enclosure wall using mechanical fasteners (e.g., nails or screws), such devices are typically hung from the shower nozzle fixture. Other techniques include mounting the storage device to the shower or bath wall with suction cups; however, suction cups have limited holding capacity and tend to lose their holding ability over time. To address these problems, shower caddies and other storage or organizing devices have been devised that utilize stretch-releasable adhesive tapes to secure the storage device to the shower wall. For example, 3M Command Shower Caddy&#x2122; products available from 3M Company of St. Paul, Minn. are available and have been well received.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variety of mounting plate or backplate constructions have been developed that facilitate secure connection between the storage device and the double-faced adhesive (and thus the wall to which the storage device is mounted). In general terms, the mounting plate serves as an intermediate structure that mechanically connects the storage device with the double-faced adhesive. The mounting plate provides a bracket or other mounting fixture along one side, and is directly attached to the adhesive along the opposite side. The storage device, in turn, carries a complimentary bracket or fixture configured to releasably engage the mounting plate's bracket, preferably in a snap fit engagement. Mounting of the storage device to a wall surface includes the mounting plate attached to the storage device, a first side of the adhesive secured to the mounting plate, and a second side of the adhesive connected to the wall surface. When removal of the entire assembly from the wall is desired, the storage device is first disconnected from the mounting plate. Once the storage device is removed, the mounting plate/adhesive can easily be accessed and released from the wall surface (e.g., stretch-releasing the adhesive). Similar designs and mounting techniques are commonly employed for other wall mountable storage devices that are not necessarily intended to be used in a shower or bath environment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many instances, the storage device in question is relatively long (e.g., 6 inches or more) and is intended to be maintained in a horizontal orientation. Under these circumstances, one or more individual strips of the double-faced adhesive are applied at or adjacent opposite ends of the storage device (via the mounting plates described above) to provide robust support upon mounting to a wall surface. Where the elongated storage device is mounted to a flat wall surface by two spaced apart mounting plates/adhesives, the above-described formats are highly efficient. As a point of reference, it is desirable to provide a rigid, snap fit connection between the mounting plates and the storage device. While this construction is highly beneficial in establishing necessary support of the storage device relative to the wall surface, variations in flatness of the wall surface can prevent complete contact (or &#x201c;wetting&#x201d;) between the adhesive and the wall surface from occurring. A typical mounting technique first entails connecting the two (or more) mounting plates to the storage device (such that the two mounting plates are spaced from one another), and then exposing an adhesive face of the double-faced adhesive carried by each the mounting plates. The exposed adhesives are then brought into contact with the wall surface typically by directing the storage device toward the wall surface. Where the wall surface is not flat across the spacing distance between the two mounting plates, one or both of the exposed adhesive faces may not come into complete contact with the wall surface. This concern is more prevalent in certain end-use environments such as shower and bath enclosures (e.g., a tiled bath wall surface is inherently uneven from tile-to-tile, fiberglass shower walls typically have a slight curvature, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In light of the above, a need exists for a storage device that can be adhesively mounted to a wall surface of a shower or bath enclosure (or other potentially uneven or non-flat wall surface) in a manner promoting thorough contact between spaced apart exposed adhesive surfaces and the uneven or non-flat wall.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some aspects of the present disclosure relate to a wall mountable storage assembly. The storage assembly includes a storage device, at least one mounting plate, and at least one double-faced adhesive. The storage device includes a main body and at least one coupling bracket. The main body can have a variety of forms (e.g., caddy, shelf, etc.). The coupling bracket is attached to the main body and forms a first engagement feature. The mounting plate forms a bonding face and a second engagement feature. The bonding face is adapted to receive the double-faced adhesive and the second engagement feature is formed opposite the bonding face. The first and second engagement features have a complimentary construction configured to provide a releasable snap fit connection of the mounting plate with the coupling bracket. In this regard, the snap fit connection includes the mounting plate being articulatable relative to the coupling bracket. The double-faced adhesive is configured to be arranged between the bonding face and a wall for securing the storage assembly to the wall. With this construction, the storage assembly can be mounted to a wall surface, with the mounting plate articulating relative to the coupling bracket (and thus relative to the storage device) to facilitate complete contact between the adhesive and the wall, while retaining the snap fit connection. In some embodiments, the coupling bracket provides a cross-bar as the first engagement feature, whereas the mounting plate includes a finger serving as the second engagement feature. The cross-bar forms a curved (e.g., convex curve) shape about which a substantially flat surface of the mounting plate can articulate. In related embodiments, the finger forms a tent-like or tapering shape about which a substantially flat surface of the coupling bracket can articulate and/or presents minimal interference to the mounting plate articulating along the cross-bar curved shape. With embodiments in which the storage device has an elongated length and is formatted to be mounted such that the length is substantially horizontal, the first and second engagement features are configured such that articulation of the mounting plate relative to the storage device includes the mounting plate effectively pivoting about an axis that is substantially vertical. In yet other embodiments, the storage device includes two of the coupling brackets, with the coupling brackets being longitudinally spaced from one another. Two of the mounting plates are also provided, with each mounting plate carrying, or adapted to carry, a piece or strip of the double-faced adhesive. With these constructions, when the mounting plates are engaged with a corresponding one of the coupling brackets in the releasable snap fit connection, the mounting plates can articulate relative to the storage device independent of one another, thereby accommodating variations in flatness of the wall surface to which the storage assembly is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other aspects in accordance with principles of the present disclosure relate to a method of mounting a storage device to a wall. A storage device is received, with the storage device including a main body, and first and second coupling brackets. The coupling brackets are longitudinally spaced from one another, and each includes a first engagement feature. A second engagement feature of a first mounting plate is snap fitted to the first engagement feature of the first coupling bracket, and a second engagement feature of a second mounting plate is snap fitted to the first engagement feature of the second coupling bracket. An adhesive surface of a double-faced adhesive carried by each of the mounting plates is exposed. The storage device is moved toward the wall such that the exposed adhesive surfaces initially contact the wall. At least one of the mounting plates is articulated relative to the main body such that the exposed adhesive surfaces fully contact and bond to the wall. In this regard, the mounting plates retain the snap fit connection to the corresponding coupling bracket with articulation of the mounting plate relative to the main body.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One embodiment of a storage assembly <b>20</b> in accordance with principles of the present disclosure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The assembly <b>20</b> includes a storage device <b>22</b>, at least one mounting plate <b>24</b>, and at least one double-faced adhesive <b>26</b>. Details on the various components are provided below. In general terms, however, the mounting plates <b>24</b> couple with corresponding components (i.e., coupling brackets hidden in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the storage device <b>22</b> in a releasable snap fit connection. In this regard, an interface between each of the mounting plates <b>24</b> and the corresponding coupling bracket is configured to promote articulation of the mounting plates <b>24</b> relative to the storage device <b>22</b> while maintaining the snap fit connection. The double-faced adhesives <b>26</b> are adhered to corresponding ones of the mounting plates <b>24</b>, and serve to adhesively bond the assembly <b>20</b> to a wall surface.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the storage device <b>22</b> includes a main body or frame <b>40</b> configured to provide a desired storage or organizational attribute(s). For example, in the embodiment shown, the main body <b>40</b> is a caddy or basket sized and shaped to receive and contain various articles of interest (e.g., shampoo bottle, soap, body wash, etc.). Alternatively, the main body <b>40</b> can consist of or include a shelf, a rail or similar structure and/or can provide other storage features of interest (e.g., a holder configured to retain a particular object such as a hand-held razor, etc.). Even further, the main body <b>40</b> can provide multiple shelves, multiple caddies, a single caddy with one or more dividers, etc. Alternatively, the storage device main body <b>40</b> can include or carry a mirror. Regardless, the main body <b>40</b> has an elongated length defined, for example, by a primary shelf or base <b>42</b> (e.g., with the construction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, where the main body <b>40</b> is a caddy, the shelf <b>42</b> constitutes a bottom of the caddy). It will be understood that a construction of the primary shelf <b>42</b> is not of particular importance to principles of the present disclosure; rather, reference is made to the primary shelf <b>42</b> for purposes of designating an intended orientation of the main body <b>40</b> during use. A longitudinal (or length) direction defined or generated by a shape of the elongated main body <b>40</b> (e.g., by the shelf <b>42</b>) is designated by the arrow X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and a transverse (or height) direction perpendicular to the length by the arrow Y. A depth direction (Z) is into the plane of the page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In some embodiments, the storage device main body <b>40</b> is sized and shaped such that the shelf <b>42</b> is intended to be arranged in a horizontal orientation upon final mounting of the storage device <b>22</b> to a wall. This orientation is reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, with the horizontal direction corresponding with the longitudinal direction X. In this same spatial orientation, the vertical direction corresponds with the transverse direction Y. As made clear below, various other features of the storage assembly <b>20</b> can be described with respect to the horizontal and vertical (or longitudinal and transverse) directions X, Y established by the intended orientation of the storage device <b>22</b>. It will be understood, however, that the storage device <b>22</b>, and in particular the main body <b>40</b>, can be configured for other spatial orientations in which the primary shelf <b>42</b> is not necessarily horizontal. The terms &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; and &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; are used interchangeably throughout this disclosure, as are the terms &#x201c;transverse&#x201d; and &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;. It should be understood that those terms are used in their relative sense only for ease of explanation and are not limiting. For example, reference to the &#x201c;horizontal direction&#x201d; of a feature of a particular object does not limit that object or feature to only being oriented horizontally.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The main body <b>40</b> can be made of any desired material or combination of materials. For example, the main body <b>40</b> can comprise a generally solid structure (e.g., a molded plastic article) that may have one or more perforations (e.g., for drainage, in the event that the assembly <b>20</b> is used as a shower caddy). The main body <b>40</b> may encompass any conceivable shape and construction, so long as it may be attached to a wall as described herein. As another example, the main body <b>40</b> may comprise a wire-rod structure (e.g., a wire basket).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the storage device <b>22</b> further includes at least one coupling bracket <b>50</b> attached to, or formed by, the main body <b>40</b>. While four of the coupling brackets <b>50</b> are illustrated, in other embodiments a greater or lesser number can be provided. Regardless, the coupling brackets <b>50</b> are configured to interface with a corresponding one of the mounting plates <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) as described below, and include or provide a first engagement feature <b>52</b> (referenced generally). The coupling brackets <b>50</b> can be generally identical and is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. For ease of explanation, only a portion of the main body <b>40</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> and is illustrated in simplified form. In some constructions, the coupling bracket <b>50</b> includes first and second legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> projecting from the main body <b>40</b>, and a cross-bar <b>64</b> extending between and interconnecting the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. The cross-bar <b>64</b> serves as the first engagement feature <b>52</b>, and is laterally spaced from the main body <b>40</b> to establish a gap <b>66</b> within which a corresponding component of a respective one of the mounting plates <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>is selectively received in a snap fit relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the cross-bar <b>64</b> defines opposing, first and second major surfaces <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>. The first major surface <b>68</b> &#x201c;faces&#x201d; the main body <b>40</b> (and thus defines a portion of the confines of the gap <b>66</b>), and the second major surface <b>70</b> is opposite the first major surface <b>68</b>. As a point of reference, a face <b>72</b> of the main body <b>40</b> in a region of the coupling bracket <b>50</b> can be substantially flat (e.g., a flatness of the face <b>72</b> varies by no more than 3% in the vertical direction Y), and each of the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> projects in a substantially perpendicular fashion from the face <b>72</b> (i.e., within 2% of a truly perpendicular relationship). The first and second legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> can be substantially parallel with one another in extension along the vertical direction Y (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), and the second major surface <b>70</b> extends between the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> in the horizontal direction X. With this in mind, the second major surface <b>70</b> is not substantially flat in the horizontal direction X, but instead forms a convex curvature in extension between the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. The second major surface <b>70</b> can have a constant radius of curvature, forming an apex at a mid-point <b>74</b> between the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> (i.e., the second major surface <b>70</b> defines a convex curve relative to a plane of the first major surface <b>68</b> and/or relative to a plane of the main body face <b>72</b> in the horizontal direction X). In some embodiments, the radius of curvature defined by the second major surface <b>70</b> in the horizontal direction X is on the order of 2-8 inches. Conversely, the first major surface <b>68</b> is substantially flat in the horizontal direction X (e.g., a flatness of the first major surface <b>68</b> does not vary by more than 3% in the horizontal direction X between the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>). As a point of reference, in some constructions the storage device <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is a homogenous structure, including the main body <b>40</b> and the coupling brackets <b>50</b> being integrally formed (e.g., the storage device <b>22</b> is an injection molded plastic article). With these and other manufacturing techniques, a tolerance range or engineering tolerance is assigned to various dimensional attributes of the finished product and establishes the acceptable limits to deviations from specified physical dimensions engineered into the product design due to manufacturing inconsistencies. The designed flatness of the first major surface <b>68</b>, for example, can have an engineering tolerance of plus or minus 0.0015 inch. The arcuate or curved shape of the second major surface <b>70</b> is well outside of this engineering tolerance range (or other tolerance range associated with the coupling bracket <b>50</b><i>a</i>) and can include, for example, a difference in &#x201c;height&#x201d; (relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) between the mid-point <b>74</b> and the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> of about 0.005-0.015 inch. In other words, the arcuate shape (e.g., convex curve) provided by the second major surface <b>70</b> is specifically designed into the coupling bracket <b>50</b>, and is not the unintended result of manufacturing variations.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As further evidenced by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the coupling bracket <b>50</b> has a width W as defined by the lateral distance between outer edges <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> of the first and second legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, respectively. The width W is selected in accordance with features of the mounting plates <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in some embodiments the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> are arranged substantially parallel with one another, and the cross-bar <b>64</b> is substantially perpendicular to the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. Further, the coupling bracket <b>50</b> is arranged such that the cross-bar <b>64</b>, in extension between the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, is substantially parallel with a plane of the primary shelf <b>42</b>. It will be recalled that in some embodiments, the storage device <b>22</b> is intended to be arranged during use such that the plane of the primary shelf <b>42</b> is substantially horizontal (i.e., arranged in the horizontal direction X). When so arranged, extension of the cross-bar <b>64</b> between the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> will also be substantially horizontal, with the curvature of the cross-bar second major surface <b>70</b> establishing a cross-bar articulation axis A through the mid-point <b>74</b>. Upon final mounting to a wall, then, the cross-bar articulation axis A is substantially in the vertical direction Y (i.e., the cross-bar articulation axis A is substantially perpendicular to the plane of the shelf <b>42</b> that is otherwise horizontally arranged). Alternatively, the cross-bar articulation axis A can have other relationships relative to the shelf <b>42</b> and/or relative to the environment in which the storage device <b>22</b> is mounted. However, the cross-bar articulation axis A is substantially aligned with the transverse direction Y in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As made clear below, snap fit engagement of the coupling bracket <b>50</b> with a corresponding one of the mounting plates <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is facilitated by a size and shape of the cross-bar <b>64</b>. In this regard, the cross-bar <b>64</b> defines opposing, first and second engagement edges <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>that bear against complimentary features of the mounting plate <b>24</b> as described below. The engagement edges <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>each define a major plane at which the cross-bar <b>64</b> interfaces with the mounting plate <b>24</b> in snap fitted engagement, and are substantially parallel with one another in some embodiments. Relative to the conventions/directions identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the engagement edges <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>(and thus the plane of snap fit interface) are in the horizontal direction X that is substantially perpendicular to the cross-bar articulation axis A.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates additional, optional features provided with the coupling bracket <b>50</b>. For example, a notch <b>90</b> can be formed in the cross-bar <b>64</b> (e.g., at the second engagement edge <b>80</b><i>b</i>). Where provided, the notch <b>90</b> is sized and shaped in accordance with a corresponding component of the mounting plates <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) as described below. In some embodiments, the notch <b>90</b> is at the mid-point <b>74</b>. Other mating features can be provided with the cross-bar <b>64</b> or at other portions of the coupling bracket <b>50</b>, and in other embodiments the notch <b>90</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with embodiments in which the storage device <b>22</b> includes two (or more) of the coupling brackets <b>50</b>, the coupling brackets <b>50</b> can be aligned in the horizontal direction, and can be grouped in pairs as shown. Other arrangements of a plurality of the coupling brackets <b>50</b> relative to one another are also acceptable. With some embodiments, an enlarged longitudinal spacing L is established between outermost ones of the coupling brackets <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b</i>. The longitudinal spacing L is a function of an overall length of the storage device <b>22</b>, and in some constructions is not less than 4 inches, alternatively not less than 5 inches. It will be understood, however, that in other embodiments, the longitudinal spacing L can be less than 4 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with embodiments in which two or more of the mounting plates <b>24</b> are provided, the mounting plates <b>24</b> can be identical. One embodiment of the mounting bracket <b>24</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref>, and includes a second engagement feature <b>100</b> (referenced generally). In general terms, the second engagement feature <b>100</b> corresponds with the coupling bracket first engagement feature <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), with the engagement features <b>52</b>, <b>100</b> having a complimentary configuration that facilitates a releasable snap fit connection. To assist in understanding a relationship of the engagement features <b>52</b>, <b>100</b> relative to one another, the X, Y, and Z directions established by the storage device <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) as described above are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> commensurate with a spatial arrangement of the mounting plate <b>24</b> relative to the storage device <b>22</b> upon final assembly to a corresponding one of the coupling brackets <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The mounting plate <b>24</b> includes a base <b>102</b>, a finger <b>104</b>, and opposing ribs <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. The finger <b>104</b> projects from the base <b>102</b> and serves as at least a portion of the second engagement feature <b>100</b>. The ribs <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> also project from the base <b>102</b> apart from the finger <b>104</b> for reasons made clear below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The base <b>102</b> is a generally a planar body defining opposing, first and second major faces <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. The first major face (or &#x201c;bonding face&#x201d;) <b>120</b> is substantially flat, and serves as a bonding surface that is configured to receive and be bonded by an adhesive surface provided with one of the double-faced adhesives <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The second major face <b>122</b> is also substantially flat in some embodiments, at least in a region of the finger <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The finger <b>104</b> includes a shoulder <b>130</b> and a capture body <b>132</b>. The shoulder <b>130</b> projects outwardly from the second major face <b>122</b> in a direction opposite the first major face <b>120</b> (e.g., the depth direction Z). The capture body <b>132</b> extends in a generally transverse fashion (e.g., the vertical direction Y) from the shoulder <b>130</b> in a manner establishing a lateral spacing <b>134</b> (e.g., in the depth direction Z) between the capture body <b>132</b> and the second major face <b>122</b>. In this regard, the capture body <b>132</b> can be described as defining an interior surface <b>136</b> and an exterior surface <b>138</b>. The interior surface <b>136</b> &#x201c;faces&#x201d; the base <b>102</b>, whereas the exterior surface <b>138</b> is opposite the base <b>102</b>. With this in mind, the finger <b>104</b> is constructed to provide a biased or spring-like attribute to the capture body <b>132</b>, whereby the capture body <b>132</b> can deflect from the normal arrangement shown (effectively pivoting at the shoulder <b>130</b>), and self-revert back to the normal arrangement. The capture body <b>132</b> includes a first segment <b>140</b> extending from the shoulder <b>130</b>, and a second segment <b>142</b> extending from the first segment <b>140</b> to a tip <b>144</b>. The lateral spacing <b>134</b> between the interior surface <b>136</b> and the second major face <b>122</b> of the base <b>102</b> tapers along the second segment <b>142</b> from the tip <b>144</b> to the first segment <b>140</b>. The lateral spacing <b>134</b> along the first segment <b>140</b> is relatively uniform. A step <b>146</b> is formed as a protrusion from the interior surface <b>136</b> at a transition between the first and second segments <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and represents a further reduction in the lateral spacing <b>134</b>. More particularly, a capture zone is established between the shoulder <b>130</b> and the step <b>146</b>, and is sized and shaped in accordance with a size and shape of the cross-bar <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The lateral spacing <b>134</b> at the step <b>146</b> is less than a thickness of the cross-bar <b>64</b>, and establishes the snap fit connection described below. In this regard, the step <b>146</b> and the shoulder <b>130</b> combine to define opposing, first and second capture edges <b>148</b><i>a</i>, <b>148</b><i>b </i>at which the mounting plate <b>24</b> interfaces with the cross-bar <b>64</b> in snap fitted engagement. The capture edges <b>148</b><i>a</i>, <b>148</b><i>b </i>extend in the horizontal direction X (into the plane of the sheet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the capture body <b>132</b> further defines opposing edges <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>. The interior and exterior surfaces <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> extend between the edges <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>. In some embodiments, the interior surface <b>136</b> along the first segment <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>) has a tent-like shape in extension between the opposing edges <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> reflects the first segment interior surface <b>136</b> forming a peak <b>154</b>, and is recessed at opposite sides of the peak <b>154</b> by reliefs <b>156</b><i>a</i>, <b>156</b><i>b</i>. The tent-like shape of the interior surface <b>136</b> is distinct from allowable or tolerated deviations in flatness due to inherent manufacturing variations. For example, the engineering tolerance for allowable deviations from flatness can be less than 1 degree, whereas the shape of the interior surface <b>136</b> represents a 2 degree (or more) relief (relative to the peak <b>154</b>) from a truly flat arrangement. Thus, the tent-like shape of the interior surface <b>136</b> is specifically designed into the finger <b>104</b> and is not the unintended result of manufacturing deviations. As made clear below, the tent-like shape of the interior surface <b>136</b> facilitates (e.g., does not cause interference with) articulation of the mounting plate <b>24</b> relative to the corresponding coupling bracket <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) at an interface between the mounting plate second major face <b>122</b> and the cross-bar second major surface <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). However, the tent-like shape terminates at or is otherwise not formed along the step <b>146</b>. State otherwise, the reliefs <b>156</b><i>a</i>, <b>156</b><i>b </i>do not extend into the step <b>146</b>. Thus, the step <b>146</b> provides desired surface area for establishing a tight snap fit at the second capture edge <b>148</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The finger <b>104</b> can include other features that promote robust snap fit connection with a corresponding one of the coupling brackets <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). For example, the finger <b>104</b> can include a detent (not shown) sized and shaped to nest within the notch <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) of the coupling bracket <b>50</b>. Other components are also envisioned, and in other embodiments the detent can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The ribs <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> project from the second major face <b>122</b>, and are located at opposite sides of the finger <b>104</b>. As identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, a spacing S is defined in the longitudinal direction (i.e., the horizontal direction X) between the ribs <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and is selected in accordance with the lateral width W (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) of the coupling bracket <b>50</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the rib spacing S is slightly greater than the coupling bracket lateral width W for reasons made clear below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the double-faced adhesives <b>26</b> can be identical and can comprise any suitable sheet, film, layer, etc. that comprises pressure-sensitive adhesive functionality on oppositely-facing surfaces. The double-faced adhesive <b>26</b> can be configured such that a first major adhesive surface <b>160</b> can be exposed for bonding to the bonding face <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) of a corresponding one of the mounting plates, and such that a second major adhesive surface <b>162</b> (hidden in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> but shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) can be exposed for bonding to the wall to which the storage device <b>22</b> is to be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The double-faced adhesives <b>26</b> can be supplied to a user already bonded to the corresponding mounting plate <b>24</b>; or, the double-faced adhesives <b>26</b> can be supplied separately to be bonded to the corresponding mounting plate <b>24</b> by the user. The double-faced adhesive <b>26</b> can comprise any suitable adhesive that is available in the form of a sheet, tape, roll, etc., from which a discrete piece of adhesive <b>26</b> can be obtained that is suitable for being contacted with and bonded to the mounting plate bonding face <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Suitable adhesives thus include double-stick tapes, laminating adhesives, double-faced foam tapes, and the like, as are commonly known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a particular embodiment, the double-faced adhesives <b>26</b> each comprise a stretch-release adhesive. Such a stretch-release property can allow the adhesive <b>26</b> to be securely attached to a surface and to be later removed from the surface without visual disfigurement of, or leaving adhesive residue on, the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A suitable stretch-releasing adhesive can comprise an elastic backing, or a highly extensible and substantially inelastic backing, with a pressure-sensitive adhesive disposed (e.g., coated) thereupon. Or the stretch-releasing adhesive can be formed of a solid, elastic pressure-sensitive adhesive. Thus, in this context, the term &#x201c;stretch-releasing adhesive&#x201d; encompasses products that comprise a unitary, integral, or solid construction of adhesive (in addition to products that comprise a backing with separate layers of adhesive residing thereupon). Suitable exemplary stretch-releasing adhesives are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,024,312 to Korpman; German Patent No. 33 31 016; U.S. Pat. No. 5,516,581 to Kreckel et al.; and PCT International Publication No. WO 95/06691 to Bries et al., the teachings of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. Such stretch-release adhesives can range, for example, from about 0.2 mm in thickness to about 2 mm in thickness. If the storage assembly <b>20</b> is to be mounted in a moist environment (e.g., if the storage device <b>22</b> is a shower caddy), the composition of the stretch-releasing adhesive can be chosen so as to maintain appropriate adhesion in the presence of moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">If the double-faced adhesive piece <b>26</b> is a stretch-releasing adhesive, it can comprise a pull tab <b>168</b> portion (e.g., an end of the adhesive piece <b>26</b> that does not comprise adhesive), which may be grasped by a user and pulled so as to activate the stretch-release properties of the adhesive when it is desired to detach the assembly <b>20</b> from a wall. A suitable stretch-releasing adhesive is the double-sided stretch removable adhesive strips available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn. under the COMMAND trade designation. Commercially available COMMAND adhesive strips are currently manufactured as discrete strips with one end of the strip including a non-adhesive pull tab to facilitate stretching of the strip during removal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A single piece or strip of the double-faced adhesive <b>26</b> can be attached to the bonding face <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) of the corresponding mounting plate <b>24</b>; or, multiple ones of the pieces <b>26</b> can be used with a single one of the mounting plates <b>24</b>. For example, if the bonding face <b>120</b> is approximately 1&#x215d; inches wide, two pieces of the double-faced adhesive <b>26</b>, each approximately &#xbe; inch wide, can be bonded side-by-side on the bonding face <b>120</b>. If two (or more) pieces of adhesive are used, the pieces may be bonded so as to not be in contact with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> illustrate a relationship between one of the coupling brackets <b>50</b>, one of the mounting plates <b>24</b>, and one of the double-faced adhesives <b>26</b>. As described above, the coupling bracket <b>50</b> is formed by or provided with the organizer main body <b>40</b>; for ease of illustration, a portion of the main body <b>40</b> is shown in simplified form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. With this in mind, the double-faced adhesive <b>26</b> is arranged such that the first major adhesive surface <b>160</b> faces and is exposed to the bonding face <b>120</b> of the mounting plate <b>24</b>. The mounting plate <b>24</b> is further arranged relative to the coupling bracket <b>50</b> such that the first and second engagement features <b>52</b>, <b>100</b> can be assembled to one another in a releasable snap fit connection. For example, and with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the mounting plate <b>24</b> is secured to the coupling bracket <b>50</b> by sliding the capture body <b>132</b> of the finger <b>104</b> between the cross-bar <b>64</b> and the main body <b>40</b>. As reflected in the view, a thickness of the cross-bar <b>64</b> is less than the transverse spacing <b>134</b> between the step <b>146</b> and the base <b>102</b> such that as the cross-bar <b>64</b> comes into contact with the step <b>146</b>, the capture body <b>132</b> is caused to deflect away from the base <b>102</b>. With further movement of the cross-bar <b>64</b> toward the shoulder <b>130</b>, the capture body <b>132</b> self-reverts back to the arrangement shown, thereby capturing the cross-bar <b>64</b> between the finger <b>104</b> and the base <b>102</b>. A rigid snap fit connection is effectuated between the cross-bar <b>64</b> and the finger <b>104</b> by robust contact/engagement of the cross-bar engagement edges <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>with the corresponding finger capture edges <b>148</b><i>a</i>, <b>148</b><i>b</i>, respectively. In some embodiments, the snap fit connection is configured to be maintained under loads (e.g., a load in the vertical direction Y) of at least 2 lbs, optionally loads up to 10 lbs.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, in the snap fit connection arrangement, the second major face <b>122</b> of the mounting plate <b>24</b><i>a </i>abuts against the second major surface <b>70</b> of the cross-bar <b>64</b>, whereas the interior surface <b>136</b> of the capture body <b>132</b> abuts against the first major surface <b>68</b> of the cross-bar <b>64</b>. Due to the arcuate or convexly curved shape of the cross-bar second surface <b>70</b> and the substantial flatness of the second major face <b>122</b>, the second major face <b>122</b> can articulate, slide, pivot or rock relative to the cross-bar <b>64</b> (and vice-versa) while the rigid snap fit connection is at all time maintained. An interface between the cross-bar first major surface <b>68</b> and the finger interior surface <b>136</b> does not overtly interfere with this desired articulation. In particular, the reliefs <b>156</b><i>a</i>, <b>156</b><i>b </i>along the interior surface <b>136</b> provide clearance for the capture body <b>132</b> relative to the cross-bar <b>64</b> as the mounting plate <b>24</b> articulates relative to the coupling bracket <b>50</b>. As shown by the arrow R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, then, the mounting plate <b>24</b> can articulate (e.g., pivot and/or rock) relative to the coupling bracket <b>50</b> (and thus relative to the main body <b>40</b>), and vice-versa. In some embodiments, the mounting plate <b>24</b> can pivot relative to the coupling bracket <b>50</b> over a range of 1&#xb0;-5&#xb0; while retaining the snap fit connection. As a point of reference, the cross-bar articulation axis A is identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. Because the component interface does permit possible sliding of the mounting plate second major face <b>122</b> relative to the cross-bar second major surface <b>70</b>, the final snap fit connection does not rigidly maintain contact of the mounting plate second major face <b>122</b> at the cross-bar articulation axis A, nor does the mounting plate <b>24</b> pivot relative to the coupling bracket <b>50</b> only about the cross-bar articulation axis A. Instead, a more rolling-like interface is established, with the mounting plate <b>24</b> capable of &#x201c;pivoting&#x201d; relative to the cross-bar <b>64</b> at an effectively infinite number of points along the cross-bar second major surface <b>70</b>. The articulating relationship can more generally be described as including pivoting about an axis that is parallel with the cross-bar articulation axis A and thus in the vertical direction Y (i.e., into the plane of the page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>) as the mounting plate second major face <b>122</b> &#x201c;rolls&#x201d; or articulates along the cross-bar second major surface <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With embodiments in which the coupling bracket <b>50</b> includes the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and the mounting plate <b>24</b> includes the ribs <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, the width W defined by the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> is less than the spacing S between the ribs <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, thereby providing sufficient clearance for articulation, pivoting or rotation of the mounting plate <b>24</b> relative to the coupling bracket <b>50</b> (and vice-versa).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a portion of one embodiment of the storage assembly <b>20</b> upon final assembly of each of the mounting plates <b>24</b>/double-faced adhesives <b>26</b> to respective ones of the coupling brackets <b>50</b>. With this one exemplary embodiment, four of the coupling brackets <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<b>50</b><i>d </i>are provided, along with four of the mounting plates <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>d</i>. As shown, the outer face <b>72</b> of the storage device main body <b>40</b> can have a curvature in the horizontal or longitudinal direction X; under these circumstances, the coupling brackets <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<b>50</b><i>d </i>may not be identical to accommodate the curved face <b>72</b> (e.g., the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> of each of the coupling brackets <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<b>50</b><i>d </i>can have differing dimensions in the depth direction Z, and the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> of the outer coupling brackets <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>can be larger (in the depth direction Z) than the legs <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> of the inner coupling brackets <b>50</b><i>c</i>, <b>50</b><i>d</i>). Other configurations of the coupling brackets <b>50</b> relative to one another are also acceptable. However, with embodiments including two or more of the coupling brackets <b>50</b>, the corresponding cross-bars <b>64</b> can be arranged to be co-planar as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The articulating attributes provided by storage assemblies of the present disclosure are further illustrated in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As shown, the mounting plates <b>24</b> have been secured to corresponding ones of the coupling brackets <b>50</b> (generally hidden in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, but shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The snap fit interface between the mounting plate <b>24</b> and the corresponding coupling bracket is such that the mounting plate <b>24</b> can articulate (slide, pivot and/or rock) about an articulation axis due to the engagement features described above (it being recalled that due to the above described rolling-type interface between the first and second engagement features <b>52</b>, <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 7C</figref>), a singular pivot axis of the mounting plate <b>24</b> relative to the cross-bar <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>) does not exist; however, incremental &#x201c;pivoting&#x201d; will occur about an axis that is aligned with the articulation axis indentified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> identifies a first articulation axis P1 established for the first mounting plate <b>24</b><i>a</i>, and a second articulation axis P2 established for the second mounting plate <b>24</b><i>b</i>. With the one exemplary embodiment providing four of the mounting plates <b>24</b> (and four of the coupling brackets <b>50</b>), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> identifies corresponding third and fourth articulation axes at P3 and P4. In some embodiments, two or more of all of the articulation axes P1-P4 are substantially parallel to one another (i.e., within 5 percent of a truly parallel relationship). Further, with some end use arrangements, the storage device <b>22</b> is arranged such that the shelf <b>42</b> is spatially horizontal. Under these circumstances, two or more or all of the articulation axes P1-P4 are substantially vertical (i.e., extend in the transverse or vertical direction Y). Of course, the storage assembly <b>20</b> can be spatially arranged in other orientations that may or may not locate one or more of the articulation axes P1-P4 in the vertical direction Y. In some embodiments, however, each of the articulation axes P1-P4 are substantially parallel to the major plane of the shelf <b>42</b>. Moreover, the snap fit engagement/interface as described above is in the horizontal direction X (to support resist a load in the vertical direction Y), and the articulation axes P1-P4 are substantially perpendicular to the snap fit engagement direction (i.e., in the vertical direction Y).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, installation of the storage assembly <b>20</b> includes attaching the mounting plates <b>24</b> to respective ones of the coupling brackets <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) as described above (i.e., snap fit connection), and bonding at least one of the double-faced adhesives <b>26</b> to a corresponding one of the mounting plates <b>24</b>. The second adhesive surface <b>162</b> of the double-faced adhesives <b>26</b> is then exposed, and the storage assembly <b>20</b> maneuvered toward the wall to which the storage assembly <b>20</b> is to be secured, with the exposed adhesive <b>162</b> facing the wall. Under circumstances where the wall in question is substantially flat, the double-faced adhesive <b>26</b> can be thoroughly bonded to the wall by simply pressing the main body <b>40</b> toward the wall. In some installation environments, however, the wall may not be substantially flat. For example, in some instances (e.g., a bath or shower enclosure), the wall can have a slight curvature and/or have surfaces that are not perfectly aligned (e.g., a tiled surface). Under these circumstances, as the main body <b>40</b> is pressed toward the wall, the mounting plates <b>24</b> can or will articulate relative to the corresponding coupling bracket <b>50</b> so that the exposed adhesive surface <b>162</b> of the double-faced adhesive <b>26</b> associated with each of the mounting plates <b>24</b> becomes substantially aligned with the contacted region of the wall surface and maximize wet out of the adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">By way of comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates desired articulation of the mounting plates <b>24</b> in securing the storage device <b>22</b> to a less-than-flat wall surface <b>200</b> (in at least the horizontal direction X shown) while retaining the snap fit connection. For ease of explanation, the storage assembly <b>20</b> is shown in simplified form, including the outer face <b>72</b> of the main body <b>40</b> being relatively flat, and having two of the coupling brackets <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>and a corresponding two of the mounting plates <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>. The mounting plates <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>have each articulated relative to the corresponding coupling bracket <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>so as to permit the corresponding adhesive surface <b>162</b> to come into complete contact with the wall surface <b>200</b>. The articulation attributes are equally beneficial with other non-flat installation environments (e.g., a shower enclosure wall forming a concave curve). Conversely, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates an attempt to secure a storage device <b>300</b> to the wall surface <b>200</b> under circumstances where the mounting plates <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b </i>are rigidly attached to the corresponding coupling brackets <b>304</b><i>a</i>, <b>304</b><i>b</i>. As shown, because the mounting plates <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b </i>cannot rotate or articulate relative to the coupling brackets <b>304</b><i>a</i>, <b>304</b><i>b</i>, the adhesive surface <b>162</b> of the double-faced adhesives <b>26</b> do not come into complete contact with the wall surface <b>200</b>. This undesirable situation may be more prevalent where the double-faced adhesives <b>26</b><i>a </i>are thin (e.g., film-based or adhesive only).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The wall mountable storage assemblies of the present disclosure, and related methods of installation, present a marked improvement over previous designs. The first and second engagement features provided with the storage assemblies of the present disclosure afford a desired releasable snap fit between the corresponding components, yet facilitate articulation or rotation of the mounting plates relative to the storage device. This relationship, in turn, better ensures proper contact of the double-faced adhesives with the wall surface to which the storage device is being secured.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although the present disclosure has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes can be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. For example, while the coupling brackets have been described as including a first engagement feature in the form of a cross-bar and the mounting plates as providing a second engagement feature in the form of a finger, these constructions can be reversed (e.g., the coupling brackets can include the finger described above, whereas the mounting plates provide the cross-bar).</p>
