         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">A variety of installed lighting applications involve lights which are extendable and
            retractable. Lighting may be installed in furniture, seating, seating arrangements,
            cars, boats, medical equipment, etc. Various mechanical mechanisms exist for positioning
            lights at various degrees of extension (e.g., springs, friction elements, locking
            assemblies, etc.). Unfortunately, these mechanisms can be cumbersome, and due to their
            reliance on mechanical devices, they wear out or become non-functional over time.
            Further, mechanical hold devices tend to be limited in the number, or variety of positions
            in which they can hold an extendable light.

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention provides compositions and methods for holding systems, devices, apparatuses,
            or portions thereof in a retracted, extended, or intermediate configuration. In particular,
            the invention provides permanent magnets and/or magnetizable materials configured
            to hold systems, devices, apparatuses, or portions thereof in retracted, extended,
            and/or intermediate configurations.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, the invention provides an apparatus comprising: (a) a housing,
            wherein the housing comprises one or more permanent magnets; (b) a support element,
            wherein the support element has an elongate shape comprising proximal and distal ends,
            wherein the support element is capable of extending from and retracting into or through
            the housing, and wherein the support element comprises a ferromagnetic material; and
            (c) a functional element connected to the distal end of the support element; wherein
            upon alignment of the ferromagnetic material of the support element with the one or
            more permanent magnets of the housing, the support element is held at a fixed degree
            of extendedness from the housing. The invention is not limited by the orientation
            of the proximate and distal ends of the support element. For example, in some embodiments,
            the proximate and distal ends are relative to the functional element (e.g., the proximate
            end is the end of the support element that is closest to the functional element whereas
            the distal end is the end that is furthest from the functional element). In some embodiments,
            the proximate and distal ends are relative to the housing (e.g., the proximate end
            is the end of the support element that is closest to the housing (e.g., when the support
            element is fully extended from and/or through the housing) whereas the distal end
            is the end that is furthest from the housing (e.g., when the support element is fully
            extended from and/or through the housing)). In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic
            material comprises a magnetizable material. In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic
            and/or magnetizable material is located at discrete locations (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
            7, 8, 9, 10 . . . 20 . . . 50, or more locations) along the length of the support
            element. In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic and/or magnetizable material is continuous
            along the length of the support element. In some embodiments, the support element
            is comprised of the ferromagnetic and/or magnetizable material. The invention is not
            limited by the type of functional element that is part of the apparatus. Indeed, a
            variety of functional elements may be used including, but not limited to, a light
            or light fixture (e.g., reading light), air freshener, speaker, microphone, mirror,
            device holder (e.g., phone holder, IPOD holder, IPAD holder, MP3 player holder, etc.),
            remote control, picture frame, drink holder, book holder, fan holder, notepad holder,
            etc. In some embodiments, the support element comprises an electrical connection between
            the functional element and a power source. In some embodiments, the housing comprises
            a free-standing base. In some embodiments, the housing is configured for mounting
            on and/or in an object (e.g., for mounting the apparatus on and/or in an object).
            The invention is not limited by the type of object to which the housing and/or apparatus
            can be mounted on and/or within. The housing and/or apparatus can be mounted to a
            variety of objects including, but not limited to, furniture, theater seating, conference
            seating, a wheelchair, a desk, a hospital bed, a wall, a car (e.g., a console or other
            part of the car), an ambulance, an ambulance cot, a boat, a plane, a train, medical
            equipment or other object. In some embodiments, the housing is configured for mounting
            the apparatus into the arm rest, back rest, side, top, or console of a seating element.
            A variety of seating elements may be used including, but not limited to, a lounge
            chair, theater seating, a vehicle seat, a hospital bed, wheelchair, ambulance or ambulance
            cot, a couch or other object used as a seat. In some embodiments, fully retracting
            the support element into or through the housing places the functional element within
            or adjacent to the housing. In some embodiments, the support element comprises one
            or more permanent magnets at one of its ends wherein the one or more permanent magnets
            interact with the housing (e.g., with the one or more permanent magnets residing within
            the housing) to hold the support element in either a fully retracted or fully extended
            configuration. In some embodiments, the support element comprises one or more permanent
            magnets between the proximal end and the distal end that interact with the one or
            more housing magnets to hold the support element in discrete partially extended or
            retracted configuration (e.g., wherein moving the support element from the partially
            extended or retracted configuration requires more force (e.g., due to the magnet-magnet
            interaction) to move to a more extended or retracted position than in the absence
            of the one or more permanent magnets between the proximal end and the distal end.
            In some embodiments, the support element is flexible, bendable, rotatable, or a combination
            thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the force resulting from alignment of the permanent
            magnets of the housing with the magnetizable material of the support element is sufficient
            to resist the pull of gravity on the support element and the functional element. In
            further preferred embodiment, the force is sufficient to resist forces caused by minor
            disturbances. In some embodiments, the magnetic interaction is easily overcome by
            a user of low to average strength. In some embodiments, the magnetic interaction is
            overcome by a force of 5-100 newtons applied to the support element. The invention
            is not limited by the amount of force that is required to move the support element
            (e.g., into, out of, or through the housing). For example, permanent magnets of a
            selected strength and/or a select ferromagnetic material for the support element may
            be used that create the desired strength of interaction between the magnet(s) and
            support element that in turn define the amount of force required to move the support
            element (e.g., into, out of, or through the housing). Thus, the force may be less
            than 5 newtons or greater than 100 newtons depending on the material and/or magnets
            chosen. In some embodiments, upon alignment of the ferromagnetic material of the support
            element with the one or more housing magnets, the support element is held at a fixed
            degree of extendedness from the housing.

         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the invention provides an apparatus comprising: (a) a housing
            comprising one or more housing magnets; (b) a support element, wherein the support
            element has an elongate shape comprising proximal and distal ends, wherein the support
            element is capable of extending from and retracting into the housing, and wherein
            the support element comprises one or more support-element magnets along the length
            of the support element; and (c) a functional element connected to the distal end of
            the support element; wherein, upon alignment of one of the support-element magnets
            with the one or more housing magnets, the support element is held at a fixed degree
            of extendedness from the housing. The invention is not limited by the type of functional
            element connected to the support element. Indeed, a variety of functional elements
            may be part of the apparatus including, but not limited to, a light or light fixture
            (e.g., reading light), air freshener, speaker, microphone, mirror, device holder (e.g.,
            phone holder, IPOD holder, IPAD holder, MP3 player holder, etc.), remote control,
            picture frame, drink holder, book holder, fan holder, notepad holder, etc. In some
            embodiments, the functional element is a light-emitting element. In some embodiments,
            the support element further comprises an electrical connection between the functional
            element and a power source. In some embodiments, the housing comprises a free-standing
            base. In some embodiments, the housing is configured for mounting the apparatus on
            and/or in an object. The invention is not limited by the nature of the object. Indeed,
            any object onto which and/or into which a housing can be mounted may be used, including,
            but not limited to, furniture, seating or seating arrangement, console (e.g., center
            console in a vehicle), a wall, a vehicle, or medical equipment. In some embodiments,
            the housing is configured for mounting the apparatus into the arm rest, back rest,
            side, top, or console of a seating element. In some embodiments, the seating element
            is selected from a lounge chair, theater seating, a vehicle seat, a hospital bed,
            wheelchair or other patient transport device (e.g., ambulance cot), or a couch. In
            some embodiments, fully retracting the support element into the housing places the
            functional element within or adjacent to the housing. In some embodiments, the support
            element comprises one or more magnets on or adjacent to the distal end that are capable
            of interacting with the one or more housing magnets to hold the support element in
            a fully retracted configuration. In some embodiments, the support element comprises
            one or more magnets at or adjacent to the proximal end that are capable of interacting
            with the housing magnets to hold the support element in a fully extended configuration.
            In some embodiments, the support element comprises one or more magnets between the
            proximal end and the distal end that are capable of interacting with the housing magnets
            to hold the support element in any position including fully retracted, fully extended,
            or any degree of extension/retraction there between. In some embodiments, the support
            element comprises magnets between the proximal end and the distal end that are capable
            of interacting with the housing magnets to hold the support element in any position.
            The invention is not limited by the number of magnets between the proximal and distal
            ends. Indeed, any number of magnets can be used depending upon the apparatus and uses
            thereof, including but not limited to: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
            14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, or more magnets. In some embodiments,
            the support element further comprises one or more support-element magnets near the
            proximal end and one or more support-element magnets near the distal end. In some
            embodiments, the support element is flexible, bendable, rotatable, or combinations
            thereof. In some embodiments, upon alignment of one of the support-element magnets
            with the one or more housing magnets the resulting magnetic interaction is sufficient
            to resist the pull of gravity on the support element and the functional element (e.g.,
            thereby holding the support element at a fixed degree of extension/retraction). In
            some embodiments, the magnetic interaction is further sufficient to resist forces
            caused by minor disturbances (e.g., inadvertent jostling, motion of a car, etc.).
            In some embodiments, the degree of magnetic interaction is configured (e.g., using
            magnets of a certain strength and/or using a specific number of magnets) such that
            the magnetic interaction is easily overcome by a user of low to average strength (e.g.,
            child, elderly person, healthy person). For example, in some embodiments, the magnetic
            interaction is overcome by a force of about 5-100 newtons applied to the support element,
            although the apparatus can be configured to be alterable (e.g., movable) with smaller
            or larger amounts of force. In some embodiments, the magnetic interaction is overcome
            by a force of 10-40 newtons applied to the support element.

         <h1>DEFINITIONS</h1>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">As used herein, the terms “ferromagnetic material,” “ferromagnetic substance,” or
            “ferromagnet” refer to compositions, objects, or materials that have magnetic moments
            with a tendency to become parallelized in the presence of an applied magnetic field,
            thereby producing a net magnetic field from the composition, object, or material.
            Some ferromagnetic materials readily retain the parallelized orientation of their
            magnetic moments when not in the presence of an external magnetic field, and thereby
            form “permanent magnets.” Other ferromagnetic materials are magnetized when placed
            in a magnetic field, but become unmagnetized when removed from a magnetic field (e.g.,
            over the course of microseconds, seconds, minutes, etc.), and are referred to herein
            as “magnetizable materials.”
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">As used herein, the terms “magnet” and “permanent magnet” refer to an object made
            from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention provides compositions and methods for holding systems, devices, apparatuses,
            or portions thereof in a retracted, extended, or intermediate configuration. In particular,
            the invention provides magnets configured to hold installed lighting in retracted,
            extended, and/or intermediate configurations.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the invention provides an apparatus (e.g., light
            fixture or other non-lighting device or apparatus) comprising one or more shafts,
            necks, and/or support elements. The apparatus is extendable/retractable, raised/lowered,
            or in some way adjusted, repositioned, and/or configured by extending and retracting
            one or more support elements. As described herein, support elements are elongate members
            with a distal end, proximal end, and intermediate region. In some embodiments, support
            elements are attached to an apparatus, device, and/or functional element on one end
            (e.g., distal end). In some embodiments, support elements are configured to retract
            into and/or through, and/or extend from, a base or housing. In some embodiments, the
            distal end of a support element is within, or adjacent to, the housing when the support
            element is fully retracted. In some embodiments, the proximal end of a support element
            is within, or adjacent to, the housing (e.g. within or adjacent to the opening of
            the housing) when the support element is fully extended. In some embodiments, the
            intermediate region of a support element is within, or adjacent to, the housing (e.g.
            within or adjacent to the opening of the housing) when the support element is partially
            extended or in an intermediate configuration (e.g., partially extended).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, a housing comprises one or more permanent magnets located within
            the housing (e.g., housing magnets), or adjacent to the opening through which a support
            element passes. In some embodiments, the one or more support elements each comprise
            ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) positioned
            along its/their length(s) (e.g., located at discrete positions or continuously along
            the length of the support element). In some embodiments, interaction between the housing
            magnets and the ferromagnetic material of the support-element (e.g., magnetizable
            material, permanent magnets, etc.) holds the apparatus at a fixed degree of extendedness
            (e.g., fully extended, fully retracted, intermediate extendedness), fixed height,
            fixed position, etc. In some embodiments, as the apparatus is extended or raised,
            the attractive force between the ferromagnetic material of the support-element (e.g.,
            magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) and housing magnet(s) hold the apparatus
            in a defined (e.g., user defined) position, height, configuration, or degree of extendedness.
            In some embodiments, the attractive force between the ferromagnetic material of the
            support-element (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) and housing
            magnet(s) prevent the support element(s) from sliding back into the housing(s) (or
            to a fully extended position) upon being placed in a partially extended position (e.g.,
            by a user). In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic material of the support-element
            is installed within or along the support element(s) at predetermined intervals. In
            some embodiments, the ferromagnetic material of the support-element (e.g., magnetizable
            material, permanent magnets, etc.) is placed at desired positions along or within
            the support element(s). In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic material of the support-element
            (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is repositional along the support-element(s)
            to adjust the hold-positions (e.g., degree of extendedness) of the apparatus. In some
            embodiments, the ferromagnetic material of the support-element is continuous throughout
            the length of the support element(s). In some embodiments, a support element is constructed
            of a ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides an apparatus comprising a light,
            light fixture, and/or light-emitting device as the functional element. In some embodiments,
            a light fixture comprises a shaft (e.g., flexible shaft) which is retractable into
            a housing. In some embodiments, the housing is a base, configured to support the light
            fixture. In some embodiments, a housing is a stand-alone base. In some embodiments,
            a housing is configured for mounting on, or installation within, an object or apparatus
            (e.g., seating, wall, furniture, vehicle, hospital bed, etc.). In some embodiments,
            the shaft of the apparatus comprises a continuous ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable
            material) along its length. In some embodiments, the shaft of the apparatus comprises
            ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) positioned
            at discrete positions along its length. In some embodiments, the housing comprises
            one or more magnets located within the housing, or adjacent to the opening in the
            housing through which the shaft passes. In some embodiments, interaction between the
            housing magnets and the ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent
            magnets, etc.) of the shaft holds the light at a fixed degree of extendedness (e.g.,
            fully extended, fully retracted, a certain degree of extendedness). In some embodiments,
            as the light is extended, the attractive force between the ferromagnetic material
            (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) of the shaft and the housing
            magnet(s) hold the light in a defined (e.g., user defined) position, configuration,
            or degree of extendedness. In some embodiments, the attractive force between the ferromagnetic
            material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) of the shaft and housing
            magnet(s) prevent the light from sliding back into its housing (or to a fully extended
            position) upon being placed in a partially extended position (e.g., by a user). In
            some embodiments, the ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent
            magnets, etc.) of the shaft is installed, attached, mounted, integrated, and/or operably
            connected within or along the shaft (e.g., continuously or at predetermined intervals).
            In some embodiments, ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent
            magnets, etc.) is placed at desired positions along or within the shaft. In some embodiments,
            ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is repositioned
            along the shaft to adjust the hold-positions of the light fixture. The light, light
            fixture, and/or light-emitting device is therefore setable at any degree of extendedness
            in which the ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets,
            etc.) of the support element is aligned with a housing magnet. For example, in some
            embodiments the locations of ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material,
            permanent magnets, etc.) along the support elements are adjustable such that the position(s)
            at which an apparatus is maintained is adjustable. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic
            material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is widely spaced along
            a support element (e.g., several (e.g., 2 or 3, or more) locations along the length
            of a support element; spaced 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 inches apart; spaced
            every foot along a support element), providing relatively few hold positions. In some
            embodiments, ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets,
            etc.) is tightly spaced along a support element (e.g., multiple (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5,
            6, 7, 8, or more locations spaced every 0.1 inches, 0.2 inches, 0.5 inches, 1 inch,
            etc. along the length of a support element), providing many hold positions, and a
            higher degree of control of extendedness. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic material
            (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is uniformly spaced along a
            support element. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material,
            permanent magnets, etc.) is non-uniformly spaced along a support element (e.g., user-defined
            positions, ergonomically-determined positions).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, a support element comprises a ferromagnetic material (e.g.,
            magnetizable material) continuously along the length of the support element. In some
            embodiment, the support element comprises a magnetizable material from its proximal
            end to its distal end. In some embodiments, a support element is constructed partially
            or entirely of a magnetizable material (e.g. iron, copper, nickel, steel, etc.). In
            some embodiments, a support element is constructed partially or entirely of one or
            more magnetizable materials (e.g. iron, copper, nickel, steel, etc.). In some embodiments,
            a support element or shaft is metallic, a magnet, or a magnetizable metal. In some
            embodiments, the inner core of a support element comprises a magnetizable material.
            In some embodiments, a support element is coated with a non-magnetizable material
            (e.g., rubber, plastic, polymer, leather, metal, etc.). In some embodiments, a support
            element comprises one or more magnetizable materials (e.g., continuously along the
            length of the support element) and one or more non-magnetizable materials.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, because the support element comprises magnetizable material continuously
            along its length, the housing magnets will hold the support element at any degree
            of extendedness. In some embodiments, because the support element comprises magnetizable
            material continuously along its length, the magnetizable material of the support element
            is always aligned with the housing magnets. In some embodiments, the presence of magnetizable
            material along the entire length of the support element provides infinite control
            of the degree of extendedness of the support element and supported device or apparatus.

         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention is not limited to a light, light fixture, and/or light-emitting device
            as the functional element. Indeed, any apparatus, device, or portion thereof may be

            is any one or more of a variety of devices and apparatuses, including, but not limited

            embodiments, the magnetic field (or combined magnetic field) of a housing magnet and
            magnetizable material of a support-element resists the pull of gravity on the support
            element and functional element (e.g., light). In some embodiments, the magnetic field
            (or combined magnetic field) of a housing and magnetizable material of a support-element
            is of a strength that resists the pull of gravity and random, minor, background, or
            unintended forces (e.g., a person sitting into a chair, a bumping the object upon
            which the housing is attached, jostling the functional element, etc.) on the support
            element and functional element (e.g., light). In some embodiments, the magnetic field
            (or combined magnetic field) of a housing and magnetizable material of a support-element
            is overcome by applying a force (e.g., 1N . . . 2N . . . 5N . . . 10N . . . 15N .

            element. In some embodiments, force is applied to the support element, such that the
            support element slides through or along the housing. In some embodiments, a force
            is applied longitudinally along the support element. In some embodiments, a support
            element is pushed or pulled through the housing. In some embodiments, a user of low
            to average strength (e.g., a child, an elderly person, a healthy person, etc.) overcomes
            the magnetic field (or combined magnetic field) of a housing and magnetizable material
            of a support-element to readjust the height or position by placing a force upon the
            support element (e.g., a force of about 5-50 N).

            In some embodiments, support-element magnets are attached to a support element by
            an attachment mechanism (e.g., clip, latch, glue, etc.). In some embodiments, support-element
            magnets are removeably attached to a support element. In some embodiments, support-element
            magnets are removeably, but stably (e.g., capable of intentional repositioning, but
