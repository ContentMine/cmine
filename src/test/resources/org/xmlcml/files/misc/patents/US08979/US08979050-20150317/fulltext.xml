<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a positioning device and, more particularly, to a positioning device for a rod.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional positioning device in accordance with the prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is mounted on a rod <b>520</b> and comprises a clamping ring <b>500</b> and a bolt <b>510</b>. The clamping ring <b>500</b> includes a C-shaped annular wall <b>501</b>, two spaced fixing plates <b>502</b> mounted on two opposite ends of the annular wall <b>501</b>, and a slit <b>503</b> defined between the fixing plates <b>502</b>. The clamping ring <b>500</b> is mounted on the rod <b>520</b>. Then, the bolt <b>510</b> is screwed through the fixing plates <b>502</b>. When the bolt <b>510</b> is screwed tightly to reduce the width of the slit <b>503</b>, the annular wall <b>501</b> of the clamping ring <b>500</b> presses the rod <b>520</b> so that the rod <b>520</b> is locked. When the bolt <b>510</b> is unscrewed to enlarge the width of the slit <b>503</b>, the annular wall <b>501</b> of the clamping ring <b>500</b> releases the rod <b>520</b> so that the rod <b>520</b> is unlocked. However, the user has to screw the bolt <b>510</b> for locking the rod <b>520</b> and to unscrew the bolt <b>510</b> for unlocking the rod <b>520</b>, thereby wasting the time and energy. In addition, the annular wall <b>501</b> of the clamping ring <b>500</b> easily produces an elastic fatigue during a long-term utilization so that the annular wall <b>501</b> of the clamping ring <b>500</b> cannot position the rod <b>520</b> exactly and closely. Further, the conventional positioning device is not assembled conveniently.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a positioning device that can lock or unlock a rod conveniently to achieve energy saving and time saving functions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a positioning device mounted on a rod, comprising a base, a press board, an antislip piece, and a positioning unit. The base includes an outer peripheral face, an inner peripheral face, an opening, and a sliding guide module. The inner peripheral face of the base defines a mounting space which is mounted on the rod. The opening of the base extends from the inner peripheral face to the outer peripheral face of the base. The sliding guide module of the base is located adjacent to the opening. The press board is slidably mounted in the opening of the base and is close to the mounting space of the base. The press board includes a guiding module which is slidable along the sliding guide module of the base. The antislip piece is mounted on and protruded outward from the press board. The antislip piece is close to the mounting space of the base. The antislip piece is made of elastic material and is softer than the press board. The positioning unit includes a shaft and a driving member. The shaft of the positioning unit is mounted on the base. The driving member of the positioning unit is rotatably and eccentrically connected with the shaft. The driving member of the positioning unit includes a pressing portion and a handle portion. The pressing portion of the driving member corresponds to the opening of the base. The handle portion of the driving member extends laterally from the pressing portion. The handle portion of the driving member is driven to move the pressing portion relative to the base between a pressing position and a releasing position. When the pressing portion of the driving member is moved to the pressing position, the pressing portion of the driving member presses the press board toward the rod to secure the rod. When the pressing portion of the driving member is moved to the releasing position, the pressing portion of the driving member releases the press board from the rod so that the rod is movable freely.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The base further includes two pivot plates spaced from each other. Each of the pivot plates of the base extends outward from the outer peripheral face of the base. The opening of the base is located between the pivot plates. One of the pivot plates of the base has a sliding face. The sliding guide module of the base includes at least one sliding guide portion formed in the sliding face. The guiding module of the press board includes at least one guiding portion slidable along the sliding guide portion of the sliding guide module. Preferably, the sliding guide portion of the sliding guide module is an elongate channel, and the guiding portion of the guiding module is a rail. The sliding guide module of the base further includes a plurality of first limit portions which are located at two opposite sides of the opening. The guiding module of the press board further includes a plurality of second limit portions secured on the first limit portions of the sliding guide module. Preferably, each of the first limit portions of the sliding guide module is a recess, and each of the second limit portions of the guiding module is a projection. The press board further includes a driven face and a fixing face. The driven face of the press board has an arc-shaped profile. The fixing face of the press board is located opposite to the driven face. The antislip piece is secured in the press board and corresponds to the fixing face of the press board. The pressing portion of the driving member presses the driven face of the press board. The pressing portion of the driving member has an arc-shaped profile. The guiding module of the press board has a bottom side provided with at least one oblique face. The oblique face of the guiding module is extended from the fixing face of the press board toward the driven face of the press board and is gradually deflected downward.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the primary advantage of the present invention, the user only needs to drive the driving member to lock or unlock the rod so that the rod is locked or unlocked easily and quickly.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The positioning unit <b>3</b> includes a shaft <b>31</b> and a driving member <b>32</b>. The shaft <b>31</b> of the positioning unit <b>3</b> is mounted on the base <b>1</b>. The driving member <b>32</b> of the positioning unit <b>3</b> is rotatably and eccentrically connected with the shaft <b>31</b>. The driving member <b>32</b> of the positioning unit <b>3</b> includes a pressing portion <b>321</b> and a handle portion <b>322</b>. The pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> corresponds to the opening <b>13</b> of the base <b>1</b> and has an arc-shaped profile. The pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> presses the driven face <b>23</b> of the press board <b>2</b>. The handle portion <b>322</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> extends laterally from the pressing portion <b>321</b>. The handle portion <b>322</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> is driven to move the pressing portion <b>321</b> relative to the base <b>1</b> between a pressing position and a releasing position. When the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> is moved to the pressing position, the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> presses the press board <b>2</b> toward the rod <b>701</b> to secure the rod <b>701</b>. When the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> is moved to the releasing position, the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> releases the press board <b>2</b> from the rod <b>701</b> to make the rod <b>701</b> move freely.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In operation, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, when the handle portion <b>322</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> is driven in the clockwise direction indicated by an arrow &#x201c;A&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> is moved toward the driven face <b>23</b> of the press board <b>2</b> by the eccentric arrangement of the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> relative to the shaft <b>31</b>. When the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> abuts the driven face <b>23</b> of the press board <b>2</b>, the driving member <b>32</b> reaches the pressing position. When the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> is moved to the pressing position, the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> presses the press board <b>2</b> toward the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> so that the antislip piece <b>4</b> clamps the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> to position the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> in place. At this time, the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> has an arc-shaped profile, and the driven face <b>23</b> of the press board <b>2</b> also has an arc-shaped profile to match the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b>, to increase the contact area between the driven face <b>23</b> of the press board <b>2</b> and the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b>, so that the antislip piece <b>4</b> clamps the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> exactly. In addition, the antislip piece <b>4</b> is made of elastic material with an antislip function so that the antislip piece <b>4</b> clamps the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> tightly and closely. In addition, the antislip piece <b>4</b> is sandwiched between the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> and the press board <b>2</b> so that the press board <b>2</b> will not directly contact the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> and will not be deformed or distorted during a long-term utilization.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">On the contrary, when the handle portion <b>322</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> is driven in the counterclockwise direction indicated by an arrow &#x201c;B&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> is moved to space from the driven face <b>23</b> of the press board <b>2</b> by the eccentric arrangement of the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> relative to the shaft <b>31</b>. When the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> is detached from the driven face <b>23</b> of the press board <b>2</b>, the driving member <b>32</b> reaches the releasing position. When the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> is moved to the releasing position, the pressing portion <b>321</b> of the driving member <b>32</b> releases the press board <b>2</b> which release the antislip piece <b>4</b> from the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> so that the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> is unlocked from the antislip piece <b>4</b> and is moved freely in the mounting space <b>121</b> of the base <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is to be noted that, when the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> is externally inserted into the mounting space <b>121</b> of the base <b>1</b>, the oblique face <b>211</b> of the guiding portion <b>21</b> guides movement of the rod <b>701</b> so that the rod <b>701</b> of the bearing unit <b>70</b> is introduced into the mounting space <b>121</b> of the base <b>1</b> easily and conveniently by guidance of the oblique face <b>211</b>, and will not be blocked by the press board <b>2</b> during movement.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is appreciated that, the second limit portions <b>22</b> of the guiding module <b>20</b> are secured on the first limit portions <b>15</b> of the sliding guide module <b>10</b> to locate the press board <b>2</b> between the pivot plates <b>14</b> of the base <b>1</b>, so that the press board <b>2</b> is positioned in the base <b>1</b> solidly and stably and will not fall into the mounting space <b>121</b> of the base <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Accordingly, the user only needs to drive the driving member <b>32</b> to lock or unlock the rod <b>701</b> so that the rod <b>701</b> is locked or unlocked easily and quickly. In addition, the press board <b>2</b> and the antislip piece <b>4</b> clamps the rod <b>701</b> the pressing position so that the rod <b>701</b> is locked tightly and closely. Further, the antislip piece <b>4</b> is sandwiched between the rod <b>701</b> and the press board <b>2</b> so that the press board <b>2</b> will not directly contact the rod <b>701</b> and will not be deformed or distorted during a long-term utilization to enhance the structural strength of the positioning device.</p>
