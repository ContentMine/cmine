<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to aircraft configurations and, more particularly, to configurations for minimizing wave drag of an air vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wave drag is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of the compression of air as an aircraft approaches the speed of sound. The compression generates a shock wave which may be accompanied by a localized change in the pressure and/or temperature of the air. At subsonic speeds, wave drag forms a relatively small portion of the overall aerodynamic drag on an aircraft. However, wave drag increases significantly as an aircraft approaches Mach 1.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Known methods of minimizing wave drag include designing an aircraft with a configuration that follows the Whitcomb Area Rule. The Whitcomb Area Rule dictates a minimization of change in the cross-sectional area of the aircraft in the longitudinal direction. In this regard, an aircraft following the Whitcomb Area Rule has a relatively smooth or gradual change in the size of the cross-sectional area regardless of changes in the cross-sectional shape. In conventional aircraft, the forward end of an aircraft fuselage may have a relatively small cross-sectional area. Unfortunately, the cross-sectional area may increase significantly and abruptly at the wings and/or engines and which may result in significant wave drag at transonic speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Attempts to minimize changes in the longitudinal cross-sectional area of an aircraft including locally necking down the fuselage at the juncture with the wings to minimize the change in total cross-sectional area at that location. Unfortunately, designing and manufacturing an aircraft with a fuselage having a variable cross-sectional shape adds to the overall cost and complexity of the aircraft. In addition, in a commercial airliner, locally necking down the fuselage at the wings may be economically undesirable due the potential loss of revenue-generating passenger seats or cargo space.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another approach to minimizing wave drag in an aircraft is by forming the wings in a swept arrangement. Wing sweep may minimize changes in the longitudinal cross-sectional area of an aircraft by distributing the cross-sectional area of the wings over a longer length of the fuselage. Wing sweep may delay the onset of wave drag rise by increasing the Mach number required to generate shockwaves on the wing surface. The increase in Mach number may occur due to alignment of the pressure isobars with the sweep of the wing such that shocks will only form when the component of velocity perpendicular to the pressure isobars reaches sonic speeds. Unfortunately, excessive wing sweep may have an effect on the low speed performance of an aircraft. In addition, wing sweep may add cost and complexity to the aircraft design and manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For aircraft operating at subsonic speeds, wave drag accounts for a relatively small portion of the total aerodynamic drag of the aircraft, as indicated above. However, a small reduction in wave drag may translate into a significant increase in fuel efficiency of the aircraft. Military aircraft that operate in the transonic region may also benefit from a reduction in wave drag with an increase in top speed and/or an increase in range.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As can be seen, there exists a need in the art for an aircraft configuration that minimizes wave drag and which may be provided with minimal impact on the aircraft design and manufacturing process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-noted needs associated with minimizing wave drag are specifically addressed and alleviated by the present disclosure which provides an air vehicle having a bilaterally asymmetric configuration. The air vehicle may include a body having a longitudinal axis. The air vehicle may further include longitudinally offset engine nacelles, asymmetrically lengthened engine nacelles, and/or longitudinally offset protruding aerodynamic surfaces including stabilizers, control surfaces, and/or high aspect ratio wings.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment, the air vehicle may comprise an aircraft having a bilaterally asymmetric configuration. The aircraft may include a fuselage and an engine nacelle mounted on each one of opposing sides of the fuselage. The engine nacelle on one side of the fuselage may have a forward nacelle extension. The engine nacelle on an opposite side of the fuselage may have an aft nacelle extension.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also disclosed is a method of minimizing wave drag of an air vehicle. The method may include providing a body of an air vehicle having a longitudinal axis oriented generally parallel to a forward flight direction, and longitudinally offsetting at least one pair of components on opposite sides of the body relative to the longitudinal axis. The components may comprise engine nacelles, high aspect ratio wings, stabilizers, control surfaces, and/or external stores.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The features, functions and advantages that have been discussed can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present disclosure or may be combined in yet other embodiments, further details of which can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings below.</p>

However, the external stores <b>300</b> may be provided in any type of store configuration that may be releasably mounted to the aircraft <b>102</b>. For example, external stores <b>300</b> may include, but are not limited to, weapons such as missiles and/or bombs, surveillance pods, or any other type of external store that may be releasably mounted to the aircraft <b>102</b>. The external stores <b>300</b> may be released from the aircraft <b>102</b> in a manner that minimizes asymmetrical loading while minimizing the rate of change of cross-sectional area of the aircraft <b>102</b> similar to the engine offset configuration <b>152</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and described above.</p>

For example, for aircraft (not shown) having more than four (4) releasable external stores <b>300</b>, alternative release sequences may be configured to minimize cross-sectional area change. By releasing the external stores <b>300</b> in one or more of the above-described manners, wave drag may be minimized which may improve range and/or increase air speed capability such as for operations near or in the transonic region.</p>

The method may include Step <b>402</b> of providing a body <b>104</b> of an air vehicle <b>100</b> such as an aircraft <b>102</b>. As indicated above, the air vehicle <b>100</b> has a longitudinal axis <b>106</b> oriented generally parallel to a forward flight direction <b>112</b>. The aircraft <b>102</b> may comprise a commercial aircraft <b>102</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a military aircraft <b>102</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a missile such as a cruise missile <b>280</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, or any one of a variety of alternative air vehicle <b>100</b> configurations that may operate at or near the transonic region or at high mach numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Step <b>404</b> of the method <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may include longitudinally offsetting at least one pair of components <b>114</b> on opposite sides of the body <b>104</b>. However, the present disclosure is not limited to offsetting even numbers (e.g., pairs) of components. In this regard, the system and method disclosed herein may include offsetting uneven numbers of components such as offsetting three (3) or more components relative to one another to minimize a rate of change in the cross-sectional area of an aircraft. As indicated above, components <b>114</b> that may be offset may include protruding aerodynamic surfaces <b>190</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) such as wings <b>192</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), horizontal stabilizers <b>268</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), vertical stabilizers <b>262</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), canted stabilizers (not shown), control surfaces <b>272</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), or any other protruding aerodynamic surfaces <b>190</b> extending outwardly from the fuselage <b>170</b> or body <b>104</b> of an air vehicle <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Components <b>114</b> may also include propulsion units <b>230</b> including engine nacelles <b>232</b> which may be wing-mounted and which may be longitudinally offset on opposite sides of the fuselage <b>170</b> as described above. In an embodiment, the method may comprise mounting a pair of wings <b>192</b> in a bilaterally symmetrical manner (i.e., non-offset) on opposite sides of the body <b>104</b>, and longitudinally offsetting a pair of engine nacelles <b>232</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and/or in one of the embodiments described above. Although not shown, the method may include overlapping a region of decreasing cross-sectional area of a forward nacelle with a region of increasing cross-sectional area of an aft nacelle as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In an embodiment, an existing bilaterally symmetric air vehicle <b>100</b> may be converted to a bilaterally asymmetric air vehicle <b>100</b> by adding extensions to one or more components <b>114</b> of the air vehicle <b>100</b> to achieve an offset arrangement. For example, bilateral asymmetry may be achieved by retrofitting an existing aircraft <b>102</b> or airplane to add a forward nacelle extension <b>246</b> to an engine nacelle <b>232</b> on one side of the fuselage <b>170</b>, and/or add an aft nacelle extension <b>248</b> to an engine nacelle <b>232</b> on an opposite side of the fuselage <b>170</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The forward nacelle extension <b>246</b> and/or the aft nacelle extension <b>248</b> may be offset by an extension offset distance <b>252</b> as mentioned above. As may be appreciated, other extension configurations may be added to other components <b>114</b> of an existing aircraft <b>102</b> to achieve bilateral asymmetry and improve the cross-sectional area distribution along a longitudinal axis <b>106</b> of the aircraft <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Bilateral asymmetry may also be achieved in a bilaterally symmetric air vehicle <b>100</b> (e.g., the aircraft of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) by the manner in which external stores <b>300</b> are released from the aircraft. For example, as indicated above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8D</figref>, bilateral asymmetry may be effectively provided by releasing external stores <b>300</b> in a sequence that minimizes the change in the cross-sectional area of the aircraft (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) and which may preferably minimize total configuration drag of the aircraft. Total configuration drag may include parasite drag (including interference drag), pressure drag, and wave drag. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>, bilateral asymmetry may also be provided by mounting external stores <b>300</b> with store offsets <b>304</b> as described above as a means to minimize changes in the cross-sectional area of the aircraft <b>102</b> which may minimize wave drag.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Step <b>406</b> of the method <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> includes minimizing a rate of change in the cross-sectional area of the air vehicle or aircraft in response to longitudinally offsetting the components. The longitudinal offsetting of the components results in a bilaterally asymmetric configuration. In any of the embodiments disclosed herein, bilateral asymmetry may be implemented in a manner that minimizes total configuration drag. Minimizing total configuration drag may include a reduction in wave drag relative to the wave drag of a bilaterally symmetric configuration. However, minimizing total configuration drag may result in a reduced wave drag that may not be reduced to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The method of minimizing wave drag may include estimating the wave drag of an air vehicle <b>100</b> as a means to determine an optimal offset distance between a pair of components <b>114</b> mounted on opposite sides of the body <b>104</b> of the air vehicle <b>100</b>. In this regard, the minimum wave drag corresponds to at least one nominal offset between the components <b>114</b>. The wave drag of an air vehicle <b>100</b> may be represented by the drag coefficient (C<sub>D</sub>) of the air vehicle <b>100</b> at a given Mach number. The wave drag coefficient of an air vehicle <b>100</b> may be estimated by calculating the cross-sectional area distribution S(x) of the air vehicle <b>100</b> over a vehicle length l<sub>v </sub>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Based on the area distribution, the method may include calculating the rate of change of the cross-sectional area distribution S&#x2032;(x) over the vehicle length l<sub>v</sub>. The graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> plots the rate of change of cross-sectional area distribution S&#x2032;(x) over the vehicle length l<sub>v</sub>.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">wherein n<sub>max </sub>represents a quantity of Fourier terms that results in convergence of the Fourier series. The above described method of estimating wave drag is disclosed in NASA Technical Note D-446 (1960) entitled &#x201c;Some Examples of the Applications of the Transonic and Supersonic Area Rules to the Prediction of Wave Drag&#x201d; by R. Nelson et al., and in NACA Technical Report 1284 (1956) entitled &#x201c;Theory of Wing-Body Drag at Supersonic Speeds&#x201d; by R. Jones.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The method may further include iteratively adjusting the offset distance and estimating the resulting wave drag coefficient such as by using the above-described method until at least one offset distance is determined where the wave drag is minimized for a given aircraft <b>102</b> configuration. In this regard, aircraft <b>102</b> components <b>114</b> such as the engine nacelles <b>232</b> may be offset within a range of offset distances that may yield two or more locations where wave drag is minimized, as indicated by the local minima <b>216</b> in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a graph plotting a drag coefficient ratio <b>214</b> of wave drag coefficient/minimum drag versus offset distance <b>212</b> as a percentage of a maximum offset distance for several bilaterally asymmetric configurations <b>150</b> of an aircraft <b>102</b>. The drag coefficient for each one of the configurations was calculated using a quantity of Fourier terms of n<sub>max</sub>=200. The configurations include offset wings <b>210</b>, offset engines <b>244</b>, and offset nacelle extensions <b>252</b> wherein the drag coefficient ratio <b>214</b> for each configuration is plotted as a function of offset distance <b>212</b> as a percentage of maximum offset. For each one of the aircraft <b>102</b> configurations, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates local minima <b>216</b> for at least two offset distances <b>212</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> only plots the drag coefficient ratio <b>214</b> for the entire length of the maximum offset for the offset wings <b>210</b>, the plots for the offset engines <b>244</b> and offset nacelle extensions <b>252</b> are similar to the offset wings <b>210</b> and may have local minima at similar locations as the offset wings <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, each one of the minima <b>216</b> represents an offset distance <b>212</b> (e.g., percentage) that minimizes the rate increase in cross-sectional area distribution. For example, for the engine offset configuration <b>152</b>, a local minima <b>216</b> of the drag coefficient ratio <b>214</b> occurs at an offset distance <b>212</b> of approximately 20 percent of a maximum offset and which corresponds to the offset arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also illustrates a local minima <b>216</b> of the drag coefficient ratio <b>214</b> at an offset distance <b>212</b> of approximately 78 percent and which corresponds to an engine offset embodiment (not shown) wherein a region of decreasing cross-sectional area of a forward nacelle <b>234</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) overlaps a region of increasing cross-sectional area of an aft nacelle <b>236</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) on the opposite side of the fuselage <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> further illustrates that for a generally bilaterally symmetric aircraft <b>102</b>, adding a forward nacelle extension <b>246</b> and/or an aft nacelle extension <b>248</b> may provide a cost-effective manner for achieving bilateral asymmetry and reducing wave drag. In this regard, an existing aircraft <b>102</b> configuration may be retrofitted without significant alteration of the structural loading of the aircraft <b>102</b>. Advantageously, nacelle extensions represent a means for modifying an existing aircraft <b>102</b> to fly at higher speeds with relatively minor redesign. In this regard, the various embodiments disclosed herein provide a means for adjusting the longitudinal location of the components <b>114</b> (e.g., wings, engines, stabilizers, control surfaces, etc.) of an aircraft <b>102</b> to improve the existing cross-sectional area distribution without changing the local diameter of the fuselage, and without the use of airfoils that are tailored for the transonic flight regime.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Additional modifications and improvements of the present disclosure may be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the particular combination of parts described and illustrated herein is intended to represent only certain embodiments of the present disclosure and is not intended to serve as limitations of alternative embodiments or devices within the spirit and scope of the disclosure.</p>
