      <p>A method for applying a clamp for a construction strut that allows a pipe to be clamped
         to the construction strut in which the clamp has a fastener that is not exposed above
         the clamp curvature and in which the fastener head is easily accessible. Also the
         clamp has a retaining tab and a neck portion such that it can be installed by straight-in
         insertion at the top of a construction strut. Also, the method has an embodiment in
         that the clamp can be installed either on the open side of the construction strut
         or on the closed side using slots in the closed side by straight-in passing the retaining
         tab past the inturned flanges on the top of the construction strut and by a rotation
         at the bottom of the construction strut.

         <h1>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to clamps that are used for clamping pipes and conduits to construction
            struts.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Construction struts (they are also called channels and framing channels) are well
            known and ubiquitous in construction, especially in commercial buildings. One of their
            purposes is to enable pipes and conduits to be installed by being clamped to the construction
            struts.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">A good reference for construction struts as well as accessories for use with them
            can be found in the catalogue of ERICO International Corporation of Solon, Ohio, and
            their website ERICO.com. One of the most commonly used accessories with construction
            struts are clamps for clamping pipes and conduits to the construction strut. Several
            of these can be found in the ERICO catalogue including a design that is also described
            in U.S. Pat. No. 4,429,440 the content of which is incorporated by reference herein.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another good reference to these products is Thomas&amp;Betts Corporation of Memphis Tenn.</p>

            	 shows in cross-section a typical construction strut (taken from the catalogue of
            Thomas &amp; Betts). These are made by the various manufacturers to dimensions which are
            either the same or sufficiently substantially the same that accessories will fit on
            those made by the various manufacturers as shown on figref[FIG. 1]
            	 but varying in height. Therefore a standard configuration of the top and inturned
            flanges and width is adopted by the industry which enables the use of various accessories
            regardless of the manufacturer of the construction strut. There are other standardized
            features one of which is providing slots on the bottom of the construction strut.
            Using the slots, some accessories can be attached to both the top and the bottom of
            the construction strut. A typical accessory is the clamp which is the subject of the
            present invention.

            	 shows three common types of pipe clamps of the prior art designated E
            <b>1</b>, E
            <b>2</b> and E
            <b>3</b>. Pipe clamp E
            <b>1</b> features separate sides 
            <b>20</b>
            <i>a </i>and 
            <b>20</b>
            <i>b </i>which are held in the construction strut 
            <b>10</b>. A perspective drawing of type E
            <b>1</b> is shown in the ERICO catalogue at page 78. Type E
            <b>1</b> is installed by fitting the separate sides 
            <b>20</b>
            <i>a </i>and 
            <b>20</b>
            <i>b </i>into the construction channel with the pipe between them, and then fastening them
            together with the threaded fastener and nut 
            <b>22</b>. Type E
            <b>1</b> has the disadvantages of having four parts (including the nut), most inconveniently,
            the clamping sides 
            <b>20</b>
            <i>a </i>and 
            <b>20</b>
            <i>b </i>being separate. It is difficult to install when there are several pipes to be installed
            close to each other because a screwdriver cannot be used and they have to be manipulated
            to be held in position as the screw is inserted to keep them assembled. Notably, often
            installation of pipes and conduits has to be done in very tight and crowded spaces.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Type E
            <b>2</b> in figref[FIG. 2]
            	 is made to improve type E
            <b>1</b> by allowing easier access to the fastener head but it too has disadvantages; when
            the fastener is tightened it tends to move to a more vertical position exposing the
            head and putting uneven pressure on the pipe.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">Type E
            <b>3</b> is shown in the Erico catalogue on page 80 and it is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,429,440.
            It has the disadvantage that it does not wrap around the pipe so the pipe is not firmly
            gripped and is subject to twisting. Also, if the fastener is tightened too much the
            pipe can be crushed; therefore, this type cannot be used on heavy duty work requirements.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">All three of these illustrated fasteners has the additional disadvantage that there
            is a portion exposed allowing injuries to workers who pass under them as shown in
            figref[FIG. 2]
            	 and also injury to hands and arms when trying to work in a crowded space. One of
            the problems in this work is that it is often done in tight and crowded spaces and
            with a lot of adjacent pipes and conduits.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is a need for a clamp that is easy to install, does not expose a fastener head,
            allows ready access for tightening and has a clamping surface to keep it firmly in
            place.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also there is often a need to clamp a pipe or conduit to the opposite bottom side
            of the construction strut, where there are slots; a versatile clamp that will work
            on both sides of the construction strut is very desirable Also, there is a need not
            only for such a versatile clamp, but one that in accomplishing that versatility also
            is easy to install.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">In construction it is often the case that construction struts will be stacked. This
            is shown in figref[FIG. 2]
            	
            <i>b</i>. In the figure stacked construction struts are shown. For illustrative purposes,
            in between struts 
            <b>10</b> and 
            <b>10</b>
            <i>a </i>there are clamps of the type E
            <b>1</b>, E
            <b>2</b> (as in figref[FIG. 2]
            	
            <i>a</i>) and between struts 
            <b>10</b> and 
            <b>10</b>
            <i>b </i>there are clamps of the type E
            <b>3</b> (as in figref[FIG. 2]
            	
            <i>a</i>). The problem with both of these clamp types lies in the dimension N, between the
            struts. The present invention recognizes the desirability of reducing that distance.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention is a strut clamp that is an improvement over prior designs in
            several aspects. One improvement is that the fastener head is easily available for
            tightening, in particular, with a screw driver, and also is not exposed above the
            top of the pipe and does not extend horizontally. Another improvement is that the
            same clamp can be used on the top (open) side of a construction strut, or on the bottom
            (closed) slotted side (that is, it has a series of short spaced-apart slots). Another
            improvement is that the clamp can be inserted straight-in between the inturned flanges
            of a construction strut; that is without an angled or twist maneuver. Another improvement
            for some embodiments is that it is easy to install because the parts can be all assembled
            into a single unit away from the strut and then be installed together. Another improvement
            is that there is always a good range of wrap-around to keep the pipe from moving.
            Another improvement is that stacked construction struts can be closer together than
            with other clamps. All of these improvements and others will be seen and further explained
            in the following description.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention is used in combination with a construction strut to clamp pipes (for
            convenience the term “pipe(s)” will be used to include all circular members, including
            pipes and conduits) that are to be clamped to a construction strut. Construction strut
            configurations are known and are available from many sources but with the same configurations
            and substantially the same dimensions, for installing a clamp. It is in combination
            with construction struts that the present invention is advantageous.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring first to figref[FIG. 1]
            	 there is shown a typical construction strut exemplary of use with the clamp of the
            present invention in which the construction strut 
            <b>10</b> in the form of a channel is defined by a bottom wall 
            <b>12</b>, side walls 
            <b>14</b> and 
            <b>16</b> and a top 
            <b>18</b> having inturned flanges 
            <b>20</b> extending from the side walls 
            <b>14</b> and 
            <b>16</b> respectively defining a space 
            <b>22</b> between them, also called a slot or channel, extending the length of the construction
            strut, and an inside distance D between the side walls 
            <b>14</b> and 
            <b>16</b>. The bottom wall 
            <b>12</b> can have a series of spaced apart slots 
            <b>24</b> (see figref[FIGS. 10-13]
            	) which are available in a variety of lengths and spacing. Construction struts are
            sold by a number of manufacturers, and are of generally standardized dimensions in
            which the height of the side walls 
            <b>14</b> and 
            <b>16</b> may vary, but the dimensions defining the width of the strut, the top inturned flanges
            
            <b>20</b>, the slot 
            <b>22</b> and the inside distance D are sufficiently substantially similar that accessories
            such as the present clamp will fit on the construction struts made by a number of
            manufacturers. As shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	 the width of the space 
            <b>22</b> is nominally ⅞ inch and the total width of the strut is nominally 1⅝ inch. The inside
            width D depends on the thickness (12 an 14 gauge are common) of the strut material
            and is not typically given in manufacturers' catalogues, however for purposes of the
            present description a dimension of about 1½ inch is taken as applicable. As for the
            slots in the bottom wall 
            <b>12</b>, a series of slots on 2 inch centers and having dimensions of 1⅛ inch long and 9/16
            inch wide is common. While the present invention can be dimensioned for various dimensions
            of the slots, a width of 9/16 and length of 1⅛ inch is a selected preferred slot width
            and length for which the present invention can be configured and it is a very common
            slotting.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to figref[FIGS. 3]
            	
            <i>a</i>-
            <i>d</i>, 
            <b>4</b>
            <i>a</i>-
            <i>b </i>and 
            <b>5</b>, in one embodiment the clamp 
            <b>30</b> of the present invention comprises three parts which are, a clamp strip 
            <b>32</b>, a nut 
            <b>34</b> and a bolt or machine screw 
            <b>36</b>. These are used in conjunction with an industry standard construction strut 
            <b>10</b> holding in place a pipe P. Pipes come in different sizes, such as from ½ inch to
            5 inch. They also come in different types such as EMT and RIGID. In general, a clamp
            is configured for each pipe size. That is, the length of the strip 
            <b>32</b> and its curvature are specific for a pipe size. Pipe sizes are specified for their
            inside diameter (ID) and the outside diameter will depend on the thickness of the
            pipe. Therefore the strip curvature will be specific for that outside diameter. There
            are some cases in which a clamp can fit more than one pipe because different pipe
            types allow this. For example in some prior art clamps a single clamp can be used
            for a ¾ inch EMT and a ½ inch RIGID pipe. Nevertheless, commonly, within the size
            range for a given pipe type, there is a clamp configured to fit each pipe size. In
            particular the length of the strip and its curvature are made to fit. However in the
            present invention the retaining tab and the neck portions (as described below) are
            configured for the dimensions of the industry standard construction strut and therefore
            will be the same for all sized clamps. In this description the term “engage” refers
            to the curvature of the strip fitting to the curvature of the pipe. The term “pipe”
            is intended to mean any of the circular items that the present strut clamp is used
            for, including pipes, conduits and other circular items.

         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the embodiment shown, the width W of the retaining tab

            <b>22</b> between the inturned flanges 
            <b>20</b> by being shorter at its first side 
            <b>53</b> relative to the first side

            <b>55</b> of the retaining tab 
            <b>50</b>. However this alignment while preferred is not essential. For example, each of the
            side 
            <b>53</b> and the side 
            <b>55</b> can be not aligned with their respective sides

            <b>38</b>, extending for example from the center a selected distance to each side. Also, if
            the neck 
            <b>52</b> is reduced in width added distance is available for the lateral extension of the
            respective sides of the retaining tab 
            <b>50</b>. This will allow more space from the neck 
            <b>52</b> to the hook

            <b>20</b>. The essential shape and dimensions of the retaining tab 
            <b>50</b> and the width of the neck 
            <b>52</b> is such that the hook 
            <b>60</b> extends sufficiently laterally away from the neck 
            <b>52</b> that it can fit under the inturned flange (see figref[FIGS. 6 and 8]

            <i>b</i>. The hook pairs are bent toward (convergently) each other, which makes installation
            easier. The convergent bending is preferably symmetrical, which allows the most convenient
            use. Each hook has an upward facing curved surface

            to fit under the inturned flanges will broadly be within this concept. While this
            new nut is advantageous for the purpose of enhancing ease of installation of the clamp,
            nuts already known can also be used in the combination with the clamp strip 
            <b>32</b> and the bolt or screw 
            <b>36</b>. The nut 
            <b>34</b> is preferably smaller in width than the width of the slot 
            <b>24</b>, preferably smaller than the 9/16 inch width of the common slot described above and

            allowing easy passage through the slot 
            <b>24</b>. In this way, with the nut 
            <b>34</b> threaded on the screw 
            <b>36</b>, the entire clamp can be assembled and installed in a single operation in which the

         <p id="p-0045" num="0044">In use the new clamp allows for clamping a pipe to a construction strut on its top,
            or on its bottom. Construction struts are well known, and for purposes of the present
            explanation of use of the new clamp, the description above will be used. figref[FIGS. 6-9]
            	 show how the new clamp 
            <b>30</b> is used to fix a pipe P to the top of a construction strut 
            <b>10</b>.

         <p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although in the figures the clamp 
            <b>30</b> and pipe P are shown on top of the construction strut 
            <b>10</b>, as is well known, the assembly may also be in inverted position, that is, with the
            construction strut inverted with the pipe suspended below it.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0047" num="0046">The clamp may be applied to a pipe already in place or the clamp can be put in place
            loosely, and the pipe inserted under it; then the clamp is tightened. With the clamp
            in place the hook 
            <b>60</b> is captured under the adjacent inturned flange 
            <b>20</b> on the strut 
            <b>10</b>. The width of the retaining tab 
            <b>50</b> is small enough that it readily fits in the space 
            <b>22</b> between the inturned flanges 
            <b>20</b> without the need for angled or twist insertion, that is, by straight-in insertion
            without the need for putting it in at an angle as would be the case if the width was
            greater than the space 
            <b>22</b>. The space 
            <b>22</b> is conventionally nominally ⅞ inch. A width of the retaining tab 
            <b>50</b> from about 1/16 inch smaller than the opening 
            <b>22</b> works well. A range from 13/16 to ⅝ inch is preferred. If straight-in insertion is
            not desired, the width of the retaining tab 
            <b>50</b> can exceed the width 
            <b>22</b> so long as it fits readily inside the construction strut.

            	, the clamp 
            <b>30</b> is shown installed on a strut 
            <b>10</b>. The hook 
            <b>60</b> is captured under the inturned flange 
            <b>20</b> while the opposite side 
            <b>53</b> of the retaining tab is not captured by the adjacent inturned flange 
            <b>20</b> (figref[FIG. 8]
            	) and does not extend to interfere with the opposite inturned flange. A good way to
            achieve this is to make the second side 
            <b>55</b> extend beyond the neck 
            <b>52</b> more than does the first side 
            <b>53</b>. That allows for variation in the capture of the hook 
            <b>60</b> under the inturned flange 
            <b>20</b> on one side while avoiding the first side 
            <b>53</b> hitting the other inturned flange 
            <b>20</b> as can be appreciated by figref[FIG. 8]
            	. Of course, in the case where the total width W of the retaining tab

            <b>22</b> between the inturned flanges 
            <b>20</b>, this is automatically accommodated since the first side 
            <b>53</b> cannot interfere with the proximate inturned flange when the hook 
            <b>60</b> is under the other inturned flange.

            <b>36</b> is tightened to the nut 
            <b>34</b> holding the pipe P firmly in place. The head of the bolt 
            <b>36</b> is presented upright from the strut and below the pipe P; it can be easily tightened
            by a screwdriver or a wrench (for hex head bolts), but it does not present a risk
            of injury, or the need to avoid injury because it is below the curvature 
            <b>38</b> of the clamp 
            <b>30</b> (see also figref[FIGS. 14 and 15]
            	). Also, adjacent clamps do not interfere with each other. Further, as seen in figref[FIG. 14]
            	, stacked struts can be more closely stacked. The bolt can have a hex head and a screwdriver
            slot, or any other type of head that is available, but preferably for tightening with
            a blade screwdriver or a Philips screwdriver.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0050" num="0049">The clamp can also be used to clamp a pipe on the bottom

            <b>24</b>, which is a common feature available on construction struts. This is shown in figref[FIGS. 10-13]
            	. First the clamp strip 
            <b>30</b> is inserted sideways into the slot 
            <b>24</b> (figref[FIG. 10]
            	) sufficiently that the retaining tab 
            <b>50</b> is inside the strut 
            <b>10</b> and the neck 
            <b>52</b> is aligned with the slot 
            <b>24</b>. Then it is turned into the cross-wise or straddle position so that the retaining
            tab 
            <b>50</b> will be captured under the bottom 
            <b>12</b> with the hook 
            <b>60</b> and the flat edge

            <b>24</b>
            <i>b </i>and rotated into the cross-wise position as shown in figref[FIGS. 11 and 13]
            	. It can be appreciated that by having one side of the strip 
            <b>32</b> having a hook 
            <b>56</b>, there is a positive connection to the inturned flange 
            <b>20</b> when installed in the top of the strut and by having a flat edge 
            <b>54</b> on the opposite side, there is a clamping on both sides of the slot 
            <b>24</b> in that configuration, the flat edge 
            <b>54</b> providing added strength for the clamping action.

            <b>10</b> clamping a first pipe P
            <b>1</b> and using a bracket clamp 
            <b>94</b> a second pipe P
            <b>2</b> is clamped above it. Under the strut 
            <b>10</b> another pipe P
            <b>3</b> is clamped in place with a clamp

            	 also shows the advantage of the invention in reducing the distance between stacked
            construction struts. In this respect, comparison is made to the distance between stacked
            construction struts which distance is dictated by the configuration of the clamps

            	 illustrates the requisite configuration for the head of a fastener to be below the
            maximum curvature (the maximum distance from the construction strut) of the intermediate
            portion of the strut clamp. The dimension M from the maximum curvature of the intermediate
            portion 
            <b>38</b> to the flat shelf portion 
            <b>42</b> must be more than the height of the head 
            <b>37</b> of the fastener 
            <b>36</b>. In most applications the fastener head height is about 5/32 in. for a hex head or
            about 3/16 in. for a round head. Therefore, the distance M is preferably at least
            about ¼ in. Also, that dimension should be less than the radius of the curvature so
            that it will not be lower than half way to the strut 
            <b>10</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0054" num="0053">The clamp can be made in a range of sizes each size made to accommodate a pipe size.
            As noted above the dimensions of the construction strut are standardized, so the relationship
            of the parts of the clamp that interact and interengage with the construction strut
            can be determined in that context. The size variables for different pipes are the
            width, length and degree of curvature of the intermediate portion 
            <b>38</b>. The exemplary version given above has a width of 1 inch for the intermediate portion
            
            <b>38</b>; wider and thinner dimensions may be applicable although a single width is preferred
            for all sizes. The length of the intermediate portion 
            <b>38</b> is selected so that the head of the screw 
            <b>36</b> can be below the upper reach of the curvature as described above.
