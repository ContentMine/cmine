      <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
      
      <div>
         <h1>TECHNICAL FIELD</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The application relates generally to gas turbine engines and, more particularly, to
            mounting engine nacelle components to aircrafts.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE ART</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">For safety reasons, aircraft engine powerplants are designed to extremely high standards,
            and to accommodate even rare situations such as bird strikes or the loss of a blade
            from one of the high-velocity rotary components such as the fan or compressor (often
            referred to as a blade-off). In the case of turbofans, the nacelle is often provided
            in the form of two halves which are hingedly connected at the pylon in a manner to
            be openable to access the engine therein. The hinges are designed to support the nacelle
            when it is open for maintenance, the expected mechanical stress during normal engine
            operation when they are closed, and the mechanical stress which can occur during extreme
            events. In the past, strengthening the hinges was a way that the loads resulting from
            an extreme event have been addressed, which inevitably leads to increased weight.
            Accordingly, there remains room for improvement.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one aspect, there is provided a mounting system for mounting a turbofan engine
            to an aircraft, the turbofan engine having a main rotational axis and an associated
            transverse axis laterally perpendicular to the main axis, and a nacelle including
            two annular halves, each half having a hinged end adjacent the pylon and a free end,
            the system comprising: a pylon; a connection configured for mounting the engine to
            the pylon and configured to maintain the position of the engine relative to the pylon
            during operation of the aircraft; at least two hinged connections, each hinged connection
            being provided between the hinged end of a half and the pylon, the hinges operable
            to permit closing and opening the halves between open and closed positions; a flexible
            connection extending between at least one of the hinged connections and the pylon,
            the flexible connection configured to elastically deform in response to a lateral
            force exerted on a corresponding half while the halves are in the closed position,
            the force exceeding a pre-selected threshold, said elastic deformation permitting
            at least a portion of a corresponding hinged connection to move relative to the engine
            structure.

         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">figref[FIG. 1]
            	 illustrates a turbofan gas turbine engine 
            <b>10</b> of a type preferably provided for use in subsonic flight, generally comprising in
            serial flow communication a fan 
            <b>12</b> through which ambient air is propelled, a multistage compressor 
            <b>14</b> for pressurizing the air, a combustor 
            <b>16</b> in which the compressed air is mixed with fuel and ignited for generating an annular
            stream of hot combustion gases, and a turbine section 
            <b>18</b> for extracting energy from the combustion gases.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turbofan gas turbine engines have an engine structure 
            <b>20</b> by which the rotary shafts 
            <b>22</b>, 
            <b>24</b> are held in respective positions relative the non-rotary components such as stators
            and casings, and which also holds the non-rotary components in proper positions relative
            to one another. The engine structure 
            <b>20</b> is engineered to withstand all forces which can be expected during operation of the
            engine. The turbofan gas turbine engine 
            <b>10</b> is held in a position relative to a wing of the aircraft via a pylon 
            <b>26</b>. The engine structure 
            <b>20</b> is secured to the pylon 
            <b>26</b>, and more specifically to a structure 
            <b>28</b> of the pylon rather than an aerodynamic skin or the like, via a primary support structure
            
            <b>30</b> which can include a plurality of main mounts 
            <b>32</b>, as known by persons of ordinary skill in the art.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">The nacelle is provided in the form of two halves 
            <b>36</b>, 
            <b>38</b>, one on each side of a central vertical plane 
            <b>40</b>, as can be seen in figref[FIG. 2]
            	. These halves 
            <b>36</b>, 
            <b>38</b> are often referred to in the art as D-ducts, C-ducts, Fan-duct halves, or Thrust
            reverser doors when the nacelle includes a thrust reverser, to name a few examples.
            Each half is hingedly connected to both the pylon and the engine structure via a corresponding
            hinged connection 
            <b>42</b>. More specifically, the halves 
            <b>38</b>, 
            <b>36</b> are hingedly mounted to a corresponding side of the pylon 
            <b>26</b>, in order to be openable upwardly to allow accessing the engine core 
            <b>44</b> of the gas turbine engine 
            <b>10</b> for maintenance and the like. The halves 
            <b>36</b>, 
            <b>38</b> are pivoted downwardly to prepare the engine for use, where they can engage a portion
            of the engine structure for support, often with mating V-grooves or the like such
            as illustrated. In this example, the two halves are latched to one another with the
            engaging portion of the engine structure trapped therebetween during use, thus effectively
            lockingly engaging the free end of the halves with the engine structure during use.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">The hinged connections 
            <b>42</b>, 
            <b>43</b> can include a plurality of pairs of hinge units 
            <b>46</b>, 
            <b>48</b> aligned with one another along a corresponding pair of hinge axes 
            <b>50</b>, each hinge axis being oriented generally along the length of the engine and pylon
            
            <b>26</b>. Each hinge unit 
            <b>46</b>, 
            <b>48</b> can include a pylon hinge member 
            <b>52</b> pivotally engaged with a nacelle hinge member 
            <b>54</b> for relative pivoting. An example configuration including both a rear pair of hinge
            units and a forward pair of hinge units is shown in figref[FIG. 3]
            	. Alternate examples can have three, four, or more pairs of hinge units depending
            on the specificities of the application and designer choice.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">Collectively, the hinged units are designed to support the weight of a corresponding
            to a nacelle half when the half is in the open configuration or moved between the
            open and closed configurations. During operation of the gas turbine engine 
            <b>10</b>, the hinged connections 
            <b>42</b>, 
            <b>43</b> are also used, in combination with the engine structure 
            <b>20</b> trapped between the free ends of the nacelle halves 
            <b>36</b>, 
            <b>38</b>, to hold the halves 
            <b>36</b>, 
            <b>38</b> in position relative to each other and relative to the engine core 
            <b>44</b>. Accordingly, at least two of the pairs of hinge units 
            <b>46</b>, 
            <b>48</b> are typically designed with a snug engagement between their hinge members 
            <b>52</b>, 
            <b>54</b>. In some embodiments, particularly in cases with more than two pairs of hinge units,
            one or more of the pairs of hinges can be designed to remain loosely engaged during
            operation of the gas turbine engine, with one or more others of the pairs of hinges
            maintaining the relative position of the nacelle halves more tightly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0022">The design process of gas turbine engines is typically assisted by computer-assisted
            simulation. Computer-assisted simulation can be used to simulate an extreme operating
            condition such as a fan blade-off scenario. Such stresses tend to occur particularly
            in the hinge pair or hinge pairs closest to the blade-off location. Using the pairs
            of hinges to withstand the extreme stresses which can occur during a fan blade-off
            scenario can allow to avoid using an additional structure to do so. However, designing
            the pairs of hinges to withstand such extreme stresses typically led to oversizing
            the pairs of hinges, which led to added weight as a trade-off. In computer-assisted
            simulation, the totality of connections between the gas turbine engine (including
            the nacelle) and the pylon are a statically non-determined set, the analytically calculated
            blade-off hinge loads are used as sizing loads in the design of the nacelle and the
            pylon structure and therefore the weight of these structures increases with the said
            hinge loads, which can form a vicious circle attracting even greater loads in the
            hinges.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">By contrast, the mounting structure described herein uses a flexible connection which
            can allow flexibility between the hinge units of at least one of the hinge unit pairs
            and the primary support structure of the engine. The flexible connection can be used
            at the pair of hinges closest to the fan, or otherwise determined to be most likely
            affected in an extreme scenario for instance, and optionally used at more than one
            hinge unit pair. This elasticity can be either permanent, or released only after a
            certain hinge load is exceeded which can be achieved by using a stiffer fuse attachment
            which collapses (e.g. shears) at a certain design load (structurally fused connection).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">The flexible connection can be clearly defined by contrast with the primary support
            structure which connects the engine structure to the pylon. More specifically, understanding
            that the flexible connection is designed to allow a pair of hinge units, to accommodate
            for extreme forces exerted on the nacelle in the transversal plane, a satisfactory
            flexibility can be defined to correspond to allowing a yielding displacement five
            times greater of either one of the associated mating hinge members than the corresponding
            movement of the engine structure for a same extreme force in the transversal plane.
            Such an amount of displacement can be considered to effectively ‘decouple’ the stress
            at the hinge from the stress in the engine structure in the context described above.

            	 shows an example of a flexible connection 
            <b>60</b>. More specifically, in this example, the flexible connection 
            <b>60</b> is provided for the given pair of hinge units 
            <b>48</b> axially closest to the fan 
            <b>12</b>. The pylon hinge members 
            <b>52</b> are provided at two opposite ends of a transverse beam 
            <b>62</b>. The transverse beam 
            <b>62</b> is mounted to a flexible floor 
            <b>64</b> of the pylon 
            <b>26</b>, which, in turn, is mounted to a structure 
            <b>66</b> of the pylon 
            <b>26</b>, rather than being mounted directly to the structure 
            <b>66</b> of the pylon 
            <b>26</b>, forming a flexible connection 
            <b>60</b>. More specifically, referring also to figref[FIG. 5]
            	, the floor 
            <b>64</b> of the pylon 
            <b>26</b> in this embodiment is made from sheet metal having a relatively thin gauge. The metal
            sheets are upturned to form flanges 
            <b>68</b>, 
            <b>70</b> which are fastened in abutment against the front and back face of an upward-protruding
            portion 
            <b>72</b> of the transverse beam 
            <b>62</b>. The fasteners 
            <b>74</b> are positioned a certain distance upwardly from the pylon floor 
            <b>64</b>. Accordingly, each transversal side of the upward-protruding portion 
            <b>72</b> of the transverse beam 
            <b>62</b> can be moved upwardly or downwardly as the corresponding portion of the floor elastically
            yields to a corresponding upward or downward force exerted on a corresponding one
            of the halves and transferred to the flexible connection via a corresponding hinge
            unit, leading to movement of the corresponding hinge unit. In this embodiment, since
            both sides of the flexible connection 
            <b>60</b> allow both upward and downward liberty of movement, torsion stress around an axis
            parallel to the main axis 
            <b>11</b> of the engine can also be accomodated.

            <b>162</b> which, itself, is received in a pylon primary connection 
            <b>166</b>. The transverse beam 
            <b>162</b> is typically rigidly prevented, by shear pins 
            <b>170</b>, 
            <b>172</b>, from sliding transversally in the pylon primary connection 
            <b>166</b> upon application of a tangential force F applied to the half. The shear pins act

            <b>162</b> and the pylon primary connection 
            <b>166</b>. If the force F exceeds a predetermined threshold, the shear pins break and the rigid
            connection by the shear pins 
            <b>170</b>, 
            <b>172</b> is converted into a flexible connection provided by way of resilient elements
