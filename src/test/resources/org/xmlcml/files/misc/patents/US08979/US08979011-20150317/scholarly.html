      <p>A winding machine includes an upper winding roller and a separation mechanism arranged
         at a location close to and below the upper winding roller. The separation mechanism
         includes a pivot shaft having an outer circumferential surface and at least one pinch
         arm having a connecting end coupled to the outer circumferential surface of the pivot
         shaft and a web engagement end extending outward from the outer circumferential surface
         of the pivot shaft. When the pinch arm is driven by a driving mechanism to rotate
         the web engagement end of the pinch arm to an engagement position where the web engagement
         end opposes the upper winding roller, the web engagement end of the pinch arm sucks
         and holds or guides a web material passing therethrough, whereby the web material
         is subjected to a pulling force induced by a roll of paper formed in a winding nip
         to tear and thus separate.

         <h1>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to tearing and thus separating a web material, and in
            particular to a method and a structure for separating the web material in a winding
            machine
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional winding machine comprises an upper winding roller, a guide plate, a
            lower winding roller, and a rider roller. The guide plate is arranged at a location
            close to and below a circumferential surface of the upper winding roller and forms
            a channel with the upper winding roller. The upper winding roller, the lower winding
            roller, and the rider roller form therebetween a winding nip.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">A core around which a web material is wound to form a roll of paper is fed by a conveyor
            to a location beside the upper winding roller and is then pushed by a core inserter
            into a passage delimited by the guide plate to reach the winding nip where the web
            material is wound around the core to form the roll of paper, such as a roll of toilet
            tissue. After completion of the winding operation of a roll of paper, a rotatable
            arm is controlled to have a speed that is faster or slower than the rotational speed
            of the upper winding roller in order to induce a speed difference by which the web
            material is torn and thus separated.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another known technique uses a method and a structure that realizes separation of
            web material with physical engagement. For example, a driving arm is positioned against
            a surface of an upper winding roller arranged in a winding machine to hold down a
            web material passing through the surface of the upper winding roller. The web material
            is then torn and thus separated by a pulling force induced by a roll of paper that
            is formed in a winding nip by wounding the paper around a core.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the above discussed conventional winding machine, care must be taken for
            the rotatable arm to rotate at a speed not equal to that of an upper winding roller
            in order to pull apart the web material through a difference in speed. In case the
            web material is made of a tough material, the speed difference between the rotatable
            arm and the upper winding roller must be sufficiently large, otherwise the web material
            would not be pulled apart by the speed difference.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the known web material separation technique that employs physical engagement, the
            driving arm must be positioned to physically contact the surface of the upper winding
            roller. This causes certain concerns about the durability and operation safety of
            the components and parts of the machine.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, an objective of the present invention is to provide a winding machine comprising
            a separation mechanism that tears up and separates a web material with a non-physical-engagement
            type operation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a winding machine that comprises
            an evacuation device and a separation mechanism comprising a suction channel and a
            passage.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further objective of the present invention is to provide a method and a device for
            separating the web material in a winding machine that employ a vacuum suction force
            to separate the web material.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The solution adopted in the present invention to overcome the problems of the conventional
            techniques comprises a winding machine that comprises an upper winding roller and
            a separation mechanism arranged at a location close to and below a circumferential
            surface of the upper winding roller. The separation mechanism comprises a pivot shaft
            having an outer circumferential surface and at least one pinch arm having a connecting
            end and a web engagement end. The connecting end is coupled to the outer circumferential
            surface of the pivot shaft. The web engagement end extends outward from the outer
            circumferential surface of the pivot shaft. When the pinch arm is driven by a driving
            mechanism to rotate the web engagement end of the pinch arm to an engagement position
            where the web engagement end opposes the upper winding roller, the web engagement
            end of the pinch arm sucks and holds or guides a web material passing therethrough,
            whereby the web material is subjected to a pulling force induced by a roll of paper
            formed in a winding nip to tear and thus separate.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the solution provided by the present invention, the pinch arm is allowed to tear
            a web material fed through a winding machine without physical contact with an upper
            winding roller of the machine. Thus, smoothness and safety of the operation of the
            winding machine are enhanced and mechanical durability of the components and parts
            of the winding machine is improved.

            	, a sequence of operations of a winding machine in accordance with a second embodiment
            of the present invention are illustrated. figref[FIGS. 13-15]
            	 illustrate the same operations as those shown in the first embodiment, but in figref[FIG. 16]
            	, in the normal winding operation of the web material, the rotational speed of the
            lower winding roller 
            <b>15</b> is slightly reduced and thus slowed down to have the web material 
            <b>4</b> slackened inside the channel 
            <b>3</b> and thus forming a slack portion 
            <b>42</b>. The slack portion 
            <b>42</b> is guided by the web engagement end 
            <b>142</b>

            <b>13</b> (see figref[FIG. 18]

            <b>4</b> (see figref[FIG. 19]
            	). The location where the tearing of the web material 
            <b>4</b> occurs is between the location where the web material
