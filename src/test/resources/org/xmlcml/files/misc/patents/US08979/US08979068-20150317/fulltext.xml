<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A differential pressure sealing device for use with ball valves that utilizes the pressure of the fluid being communicated in a piping system to increase the sealing force created by the sealing device. Fluid being communicated through a ball valve is provided to a sealing device that includes some type of element for creating a bias force. The pressure of the fluid being communicated increases the sealing pressure created by the sealing device. In this manner, the bias force created in the sealing device benefits from the pressure of the fluid being communicated to enhance the sealing when used with a ball valve or similar component.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is based on and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/441,796, filed Feb. 11, 2011.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to a sealing device for use with ball valves. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a differential pressure sealing device that utilizes the pressure created by the fluid passing through a piping system including a ball valve to pressurize a seating mechanism to aid in the operation of the ball valve.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Dirty, scaling fluids are fouling-up valves of all types in many industrial applications, including the refining, oil and gas production, geothermal power, chemical, pipeline and mining industries. The main weakness in most valves and in ball valves in particular, is that their seating designs do not keep particles and scale deposits out of the valve seat ring crevices, grooves, and cavities. This is particularly the case in trunnion style ball valves since their seat rings must be able to move axially to allow the line pressure to urge the seat onto the ball. When the seat ring cannot travel back and forth within the body end flange seat ring pocket, the seat cannot properly engage the ball seating surface and the valve cannot shut off, and/or the operating torques become excessive to the point of preventing the operation of the valve with resultant damage to the valve seats and its ball surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Trunnion ball valves, in particular, cannot be reliably used in many services such as with liquids and vapors that cause scale build-ups, and fluids that contain entrained minerals and solid materials such as sand, because such materials pack into the seat ring pocket spaces behind the seat rings of the valve and lock-it-up.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure generally relates to a sealing device for use with ball valves that utilizes the pressure created by the fluid passing through the ball valve to pressurize a sealing ring of a seating mechanism to aid in the operation of the ball valve.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The sealing system of the present disclosure is particularly desirable for use with trunnion ball valves and provides for excellent shutoff and ease of operation while at the same time eliminating the operational problems caused by sand, scale and debris. The sealing system of the present disclosure includes a two part metal seat ring cartridge that includes a chamber for energizing an axially-dynamic seat ring made by various materials, such as RTFE, peak, metals and ceramics, with a clean pressurizing fluid that is kept at a higher pressure than the pressure that the valve must seal against in the main pipe. Because the pressure behind the dynamic seat ring is higher than in the pipeline, the seating mechanism prevents the ingress of fluid from the main pipe into the seat ring energizing chamber, thus insuring the free axial movement of the seat ring against the sealing ball of the ball valve.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment of the disclosure, the seating member charging chamber can be pressurized by utilizing a spring loaded differential piston device that communicates the pressure in the main pipe to a clean fluid, such as a non-compressible valve sealant. The additional differential force to pressurize the clean sealant insures that the sealing system will always exert a higher pressure on the inside of the seat ring than the pressure of fluid in the pipe which is against the face of the seat ring. The pressure differential across the seat ring provides the force advantage that seals off the valve. The pressure differential also functions to keep any of the fluid the valve is handling from carrying sand, scale or debris into the charging chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an alternate configuration, sealant is injected directly into the seating member charging chamber from a small sealant reservoir. The system maintains the sealant at a selected, constant pressure that is sufficiently higher than the pressure in the pipe to provide the force to seal off the valve and to prevent the ingress of any of the process fluid the valve is handling.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another alternate configuration, the fluid coming from the pipe is filtered and used as the fluid to pressurize the seating member charging chamber. The charging chamber includes an additional spring to generate the pressure differential across the seat ring that is needed to provide shutoff and prevent the ingress of any fluid or contaminate into the chamber from the processed fluid the valve is handling.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another alternate embodiment, the system utilizes a compatible fluid other than a sealant or the media the valve is handling to pressurize the seat ring. As an example, air, nitrogen, water or steam can be used to charge the seating member charging chamber and power the seat ring. In the case of steam, it will be possible to more efficiently heat a valve seat ring for use in viscous services.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, thereshown is a differential pressure sealing device <b>10</b> mounted in an operative position to a ball valve assembly <b>12</b>. The ball valve assembly <b>12</b> includes an outer housing <b>14</b> that encloses a rotating ball <b>16</b> that is connected to a rotatable stem <b>18</b>. The ball <b>16</b> includes an open flow passageway <b>20</b> that allows a fluid, which may be a liquid or gas, to selectively pass through the ball valve as the ball <b>16</b> is rotated in the housing <b>14</b>. The ball <b>16</b> includes multiple seating surfaces <b>22</b>. The ball <b>16</b> is rotatable within the outer housing <b>14</b> to selectively restrict fluid flow through a piping system <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The differential pressure sealing device <b>10</b> includes a sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b> that is mounted within an internal cavity or groove <b>28</b> formed in a metallic main body <b>30</b>. The main body <b>30</b> includes an end flange <b>32</b> and an inner flange <b>34</b>. The outer flange <b>32</b> includes multiple attachment holes <b>33</b> that allow the sealing device to be connected to a pipe of a piping system. The inner flange <b>34</b> allows the pressure sealing device <b>10</b> to be securely attached to the outer housing <b>14</b> of the ball valve <b>12</b> through a series of connectors <b>36</b> and attachment nuts <b>38</b>. Thus, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the entire pressure sealing device <b>10</b> can be attached to a ball valve <b>12</b> to improve the sealing ability of the piping system</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the installation of the pressure sealing device <b>10</b> within a piping system <b>24</b>. As described previously, the pressure sealing device <b>10</b> includes the sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b> that creates a seal with a seating surface <b>22</b> formed on the ball <b>16</b> of a conventional ball valve. The pressure sealing device <b>10</b> forms part of a first embodiment of a sealing system <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The sealing system <b>40</b> includes a pressurizing system <b>42</b> that supplies a pressurized fluid, such as a non-compressible valve sealant, to power the sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pressurizing system <b>42</b> includes an inlet port <b>44</b> and an outlet port <b>46</b>. The inlet port <b>44</b> is in pressure communication with a pressure sensing port <b>48</b> extending through an outer wall <b>49</b> of the piping system <b>24</b>. The pressure sensing port <b>48</b> allows the inlet port <b>44</b> to draw a portion of the fluid flowing through the open interior <b>50</b> of the piping system <b>24</b> into the inlet port <b>44</b> through the inlet line <b>64</b>. The fluid flowing in the piping system <b>24</b> is flowing at a first pressure. The fluid drawn from the piping system <b>24</b> and contained within the inlet port <b>44</b> contacts a movable pressure wall <b>52</b> that is in direct contact with a compressed charging spring <b>54</b>. The charging spring <b>54</b> is pre-compressed by stationary pegs <b>51</b>. The opposite end of the charging spring <b>54</b> contacts a moving piston <b>56</b> that has an opposite end in fluid communication with a supply a pressurizing fluid, such as a non-compressible sealant, shown in the reservoir <b>58</b>. The charging spring <b>54</b> exerts a bias force on the piston <b>56</b> to preload and pre-pressurize the volume of the pressurizing fluid contained within the reservoir <b>58</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the pressurizing fluid contained within the reservoir <b>58</b> is a grease-based valve sealant but could be any other type of fluid, either gas or liquid, that can communicate a pressure from one area to another. A pressure outlet line <b>60</b> leads from the outlet port <b>46</b> to an inlet port <b>62</b> formed in the inner flange <b>34</b> of the pressure sealing device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pressure of the fluid within the outlet line <b>60</b> is created by a combination of the pressure of the fluid in the inlet line <b>62</b>, which corresponds to the pressure of the fluid within the open interior <b>50</b>, and the bias force created by the charging spring <b>54</b>. In this manner, the pressurizing system <b>42</b> of the present disclosure insures that the pressure of the fluid contained within the pressurized outlet line <b>60</b> is greater than the pressure of the fluid in the open interior <b>50</b> of the piping system <b>24</b> and thus in the inlet line <b>64</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a valve <b>66</b> is positioned to allow air to be bled off from the reservoir <b>58</b>. Further, the valve <b>66</b> also functions as a fill valve that allows the fluid contained within the reservoir <b>58</b> to be filled and replenished as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of the pressurizing system <b>42</b> that is utilized to create the required fluid pressure within the pressurized outlet line <b>60</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pressurizing device includes a jack pump <b>68</b> that includes a handle <b>70</b>. The handle <b>70</b> can be manually moved to create pressure on the hydraulic fluid or sealant contained within the open reservoir <b>72</b>. The jack pump <b>68</b> includes a pressure gauge <b>74</b> that allows an operator to determine the amount of pressure created within the open reservoir <b>72</b>. The alternate embodiment of the pressurizing system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> creates the desired amount of fluid pressure within the pressurized outlet line <b>60</b>, which in turn leads to the inlet port <b>62</b> formed as part of the pressure sealing device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pressurizing system <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can be modified to include a pulsation damper in the outlet line <b>60</b> between the jack pump and the inlet port <b>62</b>. Pulsation dampers are well-known components that include a bladder that is pre-charged by a supply of gas, such as nitrogen. The pulsation damper can be installed at the discharge side of the jack pump to reduce noise and vibration and create a more constant pressure on the sealing ring.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates yet another alternate embodiment of the pressurizing system <b>42</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pressurizing system <b>42</b> includes an inlet line <b>64</b> that receives the fluid flowing within the open interior <b>50</b> of the piping system <b>24</b>. The fluid flows through the pressure sensing port <b>48</b> and into a combination filter and dryer <b>76</b>. The filter and dryer cleans and dries the fluid flowing through the piping system <b>24</b> such that after being filtered, the fluid from within the piping system flows into a pressurized outlet line <b>60</b>. Since the pressurizing system <b>42</b> draws a portion of the fluid from the open interior <b>50</b> and uses the pressure of this fluid to drive the sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b>, the sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b> is designed to include a wave spring or coil spring to increase the pressure acting on the sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b> above the pressure of the fluid within the piping system <b>24</b>. Details of the use of a wave spring or coil spring to increase the pressure on the seat ring will be described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the detailed configuration of one embodiment of the sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b> constructed in accordance with the disclosure. The sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b> is formed as part of the pressure seating device <b>10</b> and creates a seal against the seating surface <b>22</b> of the ball <b>16</b>. As described previously, the inner flange <b>34</b> includes an inlet port <b>62</b> that leads into a fluid passageway <b>78</b>. The fluid passageway <b>78</b> extends through the solid body <b>30</b> of the inner flange <b>34</b> and extends into fluid communication with an annular seating member charging chamber <b>80</b>. In this manner, the annular charging chamber <b>80</b> receives the supply of pressurized fluid from the pressurizing system shown in one of the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b> includes a stationary inner ring <b>82</b>, a dynamic center sealing ring <b>84</b> and a stationary outer ring <b>86</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the center sealing ring <b>84</b> is movable relative to the stationary inner ring <b>82</b> and the stationary outer ring <b>86</b>. The center sealing ring <b>84</b> includes an outer sealing surface <b>88</b> that is urged into contact with the seating surface <b>22</b> of the ball <b>16</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a resilient O-ring <b>90</b> is compressed between a shoulder <b>91</b> formed in the inner ring <b>82</b> and a rear surface <b>104</b> of the center sealing ring <b>84</b> such that the resilient properties of the O-ring <b>90</b> creates a bias force that urges the sealing surface <b>88</b> of the center sealing ring <b>84</b> into contact with the seating surface <b>22</b> of the ball <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When a supply of pressurized fluid is received within the annular charging chamber <b>80</b>, the supply of pressurized fluid is communicated to an open cavity <b>92</b> that includes the O-ring <b>90</b> through a pressure port <b>94</b> formed in the outer ring <b>86</b>. The pressure of the fluid flowing into the open cavity <b>92</b> creates a sealing force that combines with the bias force to urge the center sealing ring <b>84</b> outward and toward the seating surface <b>22</b> of the ball <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A sealing member <b>96</b>, such as an O-ring, is positioned within an open cavity <b>98</b> to create a fluid-tight seal to prevent the sealant from passing out of the annular charging chamber <b>80</b>. A second sealing member <b>106</b> prevents the flow of the fluid in the charging chamber <b>80</b> from flowing past the inner ring <b>82</b>. A sealing gasket <b>100</b> is positioned between a back surface <b>102</b> of the inner ring <b>82</b> to prevent the flow of the fluid contained within the open interior <b>50</b> of the piping system from reaching the annular charging chamber <b>80</b>. As can be understood in FIG. <b>5</b>, the pressurized fluid received at the inlet port <b>62</b> exerts a force on the rear surface <b>104</b> of the center ring <b>84</b> to increase the pressure between the sealing surface <b>88</b> and the seating surface <b>22</b> of the ball <b>16</b>. The pressure of the sealant creates an additional force on the center sealing ring <b>84</b> in addition to the bias force created by the O-ring <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an alternate, contemplated embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the O-ring <b>90</b> can be replaced by a wave spring or a coil spring <b>93</b>. The use of a wave spring or a coil spring <b>93</b> provides another mechanism to create a bias force against the rear surface <b>104</b>. As can be understood in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the force urging the center sealing ring <b>84</b> into contact with the ball <b>16</b> is created by a combination of the sealing force created by the pressurized fluid entering through the inlet port <b>62</b> and the bias force created by the bias member, such as the O-ring <b>90</b> or the bias spring <b>93</b>. The combination of the two forces is exerted against the rear surface <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the gasket <b>100</b> and the sealing member <b>106</b> are used to prevent the flow of both the pressurized fluid received at the inlet port <b>62</b> and the pressurized liquid in the piping system from flowing past the inner ring <b>82</b>. In a contemplated embodiment, the entire inner ring <b>82</b> can be welded to the main body <b>30</b>, thus eliminating the need for the sealing member <b>106</b> and the gasket <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an alternate embodiment of the sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the sliding seating mechanism <b>26</b> includes the moving center sealing ring <b>108</b> having the sealing surface <b>88</b>. However, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the inner ring is eliminated and instead a lower flange <b>110</b> formed as part of the main body <b>30</b> is positioned below the moving center ring <b>108</b>. The lower flange <b>110</b> includes a sealing member <b>112</b>. Outer ring <b>114</b> includes a sealing O-ring <b>116</b> and a rear pressure port <b>118</b> that allows fluid to flow from the fluid passageway <b>78</b> into contact with rear surface <b>120</b> of the center ring <b>108</b>. Although not shown, an O-ring or spring could be placed in contact with the rear surface <b>120</b> to increase the bias force generated between the sealing surface <b>88</b> of the center ring <b>108</b> and the sealing surface <b>22</b> of the ball.</p>
