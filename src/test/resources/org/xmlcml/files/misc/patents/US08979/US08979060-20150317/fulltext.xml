<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present subject matter relates generally to electronic devices, such as mobile phones and tablet computers, and, more particularly, to a device holder for retaining such devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various device holders have been developed for retaining electronic devices, particularly with respect to mobile phones. Typically, the configuration of a conventional mobile phone holder is designed based on the size and shape of the specific mobile phone to be retained within the holder. Thus, numerous mobile phone holders of different sizes and shapes must be designed and manufactured to accommodate the various different types and models of mobiles phone present in the marketplace.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To address such issue, mobile phone holders have been developed with adjustable dimensions that allow such holders to accommodate mobile phones of different sizes and shapes. However, such holders typically require one or more specific adjustment mechanisms that must be physically manipulated to adjust the dimensions of the holder to match the dimensions of the mobile phone being retained. As a result, these phone holders are relatively expensive to manufacture and are often difficult to use.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, the present subject matter is directed to a device holder for retaining electronic devices, such as mobile phones and/or tablet computers. Specifically, the device holder may include an outer member and an inner member configured to be received within the outer member. The inner member may be formed from a resilient material (e.g., silicone rubber) that allows the inner member to be compressed or otherwise deformed. Thus, in several embodiments, at least a portion of the inner member may be configured to be deformed relative to the outer member when an electronic device is inserted into the holder, with the amount of deformation of the inner member varying based on the dimensions of the electronic device. As such, the device holder may be configured to accommodate electronic devices of varying sizes and shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> illustrate one embodiment of a device holder <b>10</b> for retaining an electronic device <b>12</b> in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. As shown, the device holder <b>10</b> may generally include an outer member <b>14</b> and an inner member <b>16</b>. The outer member <b>14</b> may define an outer slot <b>18</b> configured to at least partially receive the inner member <b>16</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the outer member <b>14</b> may include a back wall <b>20</b>, a first outer sidewall <b>22</b>, a second outer sidewall <b>24</b> and a bottom wall <b>26</b>, with the outer sidewalls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the bottom wall <b>26</b> extending from the back wall <b>20</b> so as to define an open-ended, outwardly facing slot <b>18</b>. Thus, when the device <b>10</b> is assembled, the inner member <b>16</b> may be received within the outer slot <b>18</b> such that the outer member <b>14</b> at least partially surrounds and/or retains the inner member <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It should be appreciated that the outer member <b>14</b> may generally be formed from any suitable material. For example, in several embodiments, the outer member <b>14</b> may be formed from a rigid or a semi-rigid material, such as a rigid or semi-rigid plastic material or a metal material (e.g. aluminum). It should also be appreciated that both the dimensions and shape of the outer slot <b>18</b> may generally be selected based on the dimensions and/or shape of the inner member <b>16</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the outer slot <b>18</b> defines a rectangular shape generally corresponding to the rectangular-shaped footprint of the inner member <b>16</b>. However, in other embodiments, the outer slot <b>18</b> may be configured to define any other suitable shape that permits at least a portion of the inner member <b>16</b> to be received within the slot <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additionally, it should be appreciated that the inner member <b>16</b> may be configured to be retained within the slot <b>18</b> using any suitable means. For example, in one embodiment, the inner member <b>16</b> may simply be retained within the slot <b>18</b> via the frictional interface created between the inner and outer members <b>16</b>, <b>14</b>. In another embodiment, the inner member <b>16</b> may be secured within the outer slot <b>18</b> using a suitable adhesive. In a further embodiment, mechanical fasteners, mating features and/or any other suitable attachment means may be utilized to secure the inner member <b>16</b> within the outer slot <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inner member <b>16</b> of the disclosed holder <b>10</b> may generally be configured to define an inner slot <b>28</b> configured to at least partially receive the electronic device <b>12</b> being retained within the holder <b>10</b>. For example, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, the inner member <b>16</b> may include a back wall <b>30</b>, a first inner sidewall <b>32</b>, a second inner sidewall <b>34</b> and a bottom wall <b>36</b>, with the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and the bottom wall <b>36</b> extending from the back wall <b>30</b> so as to define an open-ended, outwardly facing slot <b>28</b>. Thus, during use of the disclosed holder <b>10</b>, the electronic device <b>12</b> may be received within the inner slot <b>28</b> such that the inner member <b>16</b> at least partially surrounds and retains the electronic device <b>12</b> within the holder <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In several embodiments, at least a portion of each of the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be configured to extend from the back wall <b>30</b> at an angle. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first angled portion <b>38</b> of the first inner sidewall <b>32</b> may be configured to extend inwardly from the back wall <b>30</b> so that a first acute angle <b>40</b> is defined between the inner sidewall <b>32</b> and the back wall <b>30</b> and a second angled portion <b>42</b> of the second inner sidewall <b>34</b> may be configured to extend inwardly from the back wall <b>30</b> so that a second acute angle <b>44</b> is defined between the inner sidewall <b>34</b> and the back wall <b>30</b>. As such, the inner slot <b>28</b> defined between the first and second inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may generally converge as the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> extend from the back wall <b>30</b> to an open end <b>46</b> of the slot <b>28</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be angled inwardly from the back wall <b>30</b> such that a width <b>48</b> of the inner slot <b>28</b> at the back wall <b>30</b> is greater than a width <b>50</b> of the slot <b>28</b> at its open end <b>46</b>, thereby defining a dovetail-like shape.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, as particularly shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, at least a portion of the outer surface of the first and second outer sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be recessed inwardly such that open volumes or cavities <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> are defined between the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and the outer sidewalls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> when the inner member <b>16</b> is received within the outer member <b>14</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first cavity <b>70</b> may be defined between the first inner sidewall <b>32</b> and the first outer sidewall <b>22</b>. Similarly, a second cavity <b>72</b> may be defined between the second inner sidewall <b>34</b> and the second outer sidewall <b>24</b>. As will be described below, such cavities <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> may permit the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to be deformed relative to the outer sidewalls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, thereby allowing the device holder <b>10</b> to accommodate devices <b>12</b> of varying sizes and shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It should be appreciated that, in several embodiments, the angle <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> defined between each inner sidewall <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and the back wall <b>30</b>, as well as a length <b>52</b> of each angled portion <b>38</b>, <b>42</b>, may be selected based on the dimensions of the smallest electronic device <b>12</b> that is to be retained within the device holder <b>10</b>. Specifically, in one embodiment, the angles <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> and/or lengths <b>52</b> may be selected based on a minimum width <b>54</b> and/or a minimum depth <b>56</b> of the smallest electronic device <b>12</b>. Thus, when an electronic device <b>12</b> defining such minimum width <b>54</b> and/or minimum depth <b>54</b> is inserted into the inner slot <b>28</b>, the device <b>12</b> may be retained within the inner slot <b>28</b> between the back wall <b>30</b> and the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, in several embodiments, the inner member <b>16</b> may be formed from a flexible or resilient material, such as silicone rubber, other rubber materials, or any other suitable flexible/resilient material. As such, the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> of the inner member <b>16</b> may be configured to be deformed into the open spaces or cavities <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> when an electronic device <b>12</b> is inserted into the inner slot <b>28</b> that defines a width and/or a depth that is larger than the minimum width <b>54</b> and/or the minimum depth <b>56</b> for which the device holder <b>10</b> has been designed. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the disclosed holder after an electronic device <b>12</b> has been inserted into the inner slot <b>28</b> that defines a width <b>58</b> that is greater than the minimum width <b>54</b>. As shown, due to the width <b>58</b> of the device <b>12</b>, the resilient inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be deformed between the electronic device <b>12</b> and the outer sidewalls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the outer member <b>14</b>. Such deformation of the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may generate a reactive force (indicated by arrows <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that is applied inwardly against the electronic device <b>12</b>, thereby retaining the device <b>12</b> within the inner slot <b>28</b>. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, such deformation may also cause the portions of the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> not positioned directly between the electronic device <b>12</b> and the outer sidewalls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> (i.e., the portions of the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> closest to the open end <b>46</b> of the slot <b>28</b>) to deform inwardly, thereby creating a lip or flange around the outer edge of the electronic device <b>12</b> that further retains the device <b>12</b> within the inner slot <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should be appreciated that, in several embodiments, the width <b>48</b> of the inner slot <b>28</b> may be selected based on the width (e.g., width <b>58</b>) of the widest electronic device <b>10</b> that is to be retained within the device holder <b>10</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the width <b>48</b> may be equal to or slightly larger than the maximum width to be accommodated. Alternatively, since the thickness of the inner sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be reduced as the resilient material of the inner member <b>16</b> is deformed, the width <b>48</b> may be configured to be slightly smaller than the maximum width.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Additionally, it should be appreciated that the components of the disclosed device holder <b>10</b> may generally be configured to accommodate any suitable electronic device. For example, in several embodiments, the inner and outer members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be dimensioned so as to allow various different mobile phones to be retained within the holder <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the inner and outer members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be dimensioned so as to allow various different tablet computers to be retained within the holder <b>10</b>. In further embodiments, the inner and outer members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be dimensioned so as to allow any other suitable electronic devices to be retained within the holder <b>10</b>, such as digital cameras and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should also be appreciated the disclosed holder <b>10</b> may be configured as a stand-alone device or may form part of any other suitable device/assembly. Specifically, in several embodiments, the outer member <b>14</b> of the holder <b>10</b> may be formed integrally with and/or may be separately assembled into any suitable device/assembly that may be associated with an electronic device <b>12</b>. For example, the outer member <b>14</b> may form all or part of a base configured for supporting the electronic device <b>12</b> within a vehicle (e.g., to mount the electronic device to the dashboard) or relative to any suitable surface. Specifically, in one embodiment, the outer member <b>14</b> may be configured to be coupled to a suitable frame for positioning the electronic device <b>12</b> relative to a given location (e.g., in front of a user of the device or adjacent to an object being imaged using the device <b>12</b>). In another embodiment, the outer member <b>14</b> may form all or part of a base or frame configured to be clipped to a user's belt or otherwise secured to any other suitable object.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, it should be appreciated that, although the present subject matter has been described herein as including an inner member <b>16</b> having first and second resilient sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, the inner member <b>16</b> may be configured to only include a single resilient sidewall. For example, in one embodiment, one of the sidewalls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be formed from a resilient material while the other sidewall <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be formed from a rigid material.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the present subject matter has been described in detail with respect to specific exemplary embodiments and methods thereof, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art, upon attaining an understanding of the foregoing may readily produce alterations to, variations of, and equivalents to such embodiments. Accordingly, the scope of the present disclosure is by way of example rather than by way of limitation, and the subject disclosure does not preclude inclusion of such modifications, variations and/or additions to the present subject matter as would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
