<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed is a vertical rudder control system for an aircraft. The system is comprised of a rudder trim compensation generator that is configured to generate a rudder trim compensation order to set the position of the rudder bar of the aircraft to a neutral position in which the rudder bar is controlled with nil (i.e., zero) pilot effort. The vertical rudder control system includes a flight control calculator for calculating rudder control orders to maintain the nil effort rudder bar position, with the calculation of the rudder control orders being based on a sum of the rudder bar position, determined by a detection unit, and the rudder trim compensation order. The rudder control orders are received by a rudder operating unit, which is used to deflect the vertical rudder by a deflection value based on the rudder control orders.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a rudder control system for an aircraft, of an electrical type, with no mechanical rudder compensation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Each aircraft is provided with a flight command system connecting the piloting units (stick, rudder bar) with the aerodynamic control surfaces (ailerons, spoilers, vertical rudder, pitch motivator) of the aircraft. Those systems have been developed over the time with the technical progress from purely mechanical non-assisted systems to electrical (command) systems being hydraulically assisted.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the first systems, the effort exerted by the pilot on the piloting units was integrally transmitted to the rudders and corresponded to the aerodynamic efforts. In order to minimize the muscular efforts, compensators or trims have been created to be able to vary the control surface position corresponding to a nil muscular effort from the pilot.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Over the technical evolutions, the trims have been essentially kept for operational needs (from the pilots). As on the present rudder control systems, there is no more mechanical connection between the rudder bar and the vertical rudder, the trim only serves to vary the nil effort position of the rudder bar.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Usually, a rudder control system for an aircraft, in particular for an airplane, of the electrical type, comprises:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">a rudder bar adapted to be operated by a pilot;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">means for detecting the position of the rudder bar and generating an electrical control signal being representative of such position; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0008">a flight control calculator receiving such electrical control signal and generating, with the help of the latter, control orders being transmitted to actuating means for a vertical rudder of the aircraft.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0009">The vertical rudder is so called electrical, since the order controlled by the pilot (position of the rudder bar) is transmitted to the flight control calculator under the shape of an electrical signal. The calculator uses then such pilot order to determine, thru internal control laws, the control order being effectively applied to the vertical rudder.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">Despite such electrical characteristics, the rudder bar remains a complex mechanical unit. It especially comprises a spring assembly being able to create again an artificial sensation (as the rudder bar is not mechanically connected with the control surface of the aircraft anymore). Such artificial sensation generating means also comprise a mechanical rudder compensation or trim function. Such a function being implemented by a mechanical compensator or trim allows the pilot to control the nil effort rudder bar position. The control is carried out by the pilot thru buttons located in the cockpit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0011">Such mechanical rudder trim meets several operational needs:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0012">in the case of an engine failure.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0013">The failure of an engine of the aircraft generates a yawing moment. Thus, in order to keep an optimum flight line, the pilot must control a rudder bar order so that the vertical rudder generates a corrective yawing moment being opposed to the moment related to the engine failure.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0014">The constant application of such order obliges the pilot to exert a constant muscular effort on the rudder bar. In order to enable the pilot to release the pedals while keeping his position (and thus his order), he calls on the mechanical rudder trim function.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0015">The use of such function allows the nil effort position (initially supposed to be the neutral position) to be brought up to the current position of the rudder bar (required by the pilot). Thus, the pilot may release the rudder bar while keeping the current position; and
        <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0016">in the case of an airplane being twisted or asymmetrically loaded (fuel, passengers).</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0017">In those cases, the pilot can be in a position to ask for a constant slight rudder order so as to cancel or to compensate for the dissymmetry (optimum sideslip, minimum rudder clearance). To do so, the pilot may call on the mechanical rudder trim function. Thus, the rudder bar can take a non nil order without the pilot operates on the pedals (by a slight displacement of the nil effort point).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0018">The presence, on an electrical rudder control system such as described above, of a mechanical rudder trim meeting the above mentioned needs, has some disadvantages, in particular in terms of mass, cost, installation, congestion, maintenance, overall reliability, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0019">The present invention aims at simplifying such electrical rudder control system and cancelling the mechanical compensation function. It relates to a rudder control system for an aircraft, of an electrical type, without any mechanical control trim which allows, despite the absence of a mechanical trim, to meet the operational needs related to such a trim.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0020">With this end in view, according to the invention, said rudder control system of the type comprising:
<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0021">a rudder bar (pedals) being adapted to be actuated by a pilot of the aircraft;</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0022">means for automatically detecting the position of the rudder bar and generating an electrical control signal being representative of such position; and</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0003" num="0023">calculation means receiving such electrical control signal and automatically generating, thru at least the latter, control orders which are transmitted to operating means for a vertical rudder of the aircraft,
<br/>
is remarkable in that it comprised additionally:
</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0004" num="0024">auxiliary means for generating a rudder trim order under the shape of an auxiliary electrical signal so that the nil effort rudder bar position is the neutral position of the rudder bar; and</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0005" num="0025">means to transmit such auxiliary electrical signal to said calculation means being formed so as to generate, thru both this auxiliary electrical signal and said electrical control signal, the control orders which are transmitted to the operating means for the vertical rudder, said control orders being calculated from an overall order corresponding to the sum of the order relative to the rudder bar position represented by the electrical control signal and the compensation order represented by the auxiliary electrical signal generated by said auxiliary means so that the nil effort rudder bar position is always the neutral position of the rudder bar.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0026">Consequently, thanks to the invention, the actions to meet the operational needs relative to a rudder trim are not implemented by a usual mechanical compensator, the rudder control system of which is absent, but by the generation and the application of a rudder trim order being transmitted (under the shape of an electrical signal) to the calculation means (or a flight control calculator) which use it to calculate the rudder control orders. The nil effort rudder bar position is thus always the neutral position of the rudder bar.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0027">The cancelation on the rudder control system of the usual mechanical trim thus generates gains on the aircraft mass, costs, installation facility, maintenance operations and overall reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0028">In one first embodiment, said auxiliary means comprise automatic means for automatically determining, upon a failure of an engine of the aircraft, a compensation or trim order enabling a yawing moment generated by the engine failure to be compensated. Moreover, advantageously, said auxiliary means also comprise means for automatically detecting such a failure.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0029">This first embodiment only applies in the case of an engine failure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0030">Moreover, in a second embodiment, instead of or in addition to said first embodiment, said auxiliary means also comprise hand operated means so as to allow the pilot to control (that is to say to select hand operation) a compensation order which is transmitted to the calculation means.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0031">This second embodiment can be used in any situation of the aircraft requiring dissymmetry compensation, especially in the case of an aircraft being twisted or asymmetrically loaded (fuel, passengers).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0032">Upon an engine failure, both embodiments can thus be used together or separately. In particular, the pilot can use the second embodiment to make a hand operated control in case of a failure of the automatic yawing moment compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0033">The hand operated means of said second embodiment can be realized on different ways.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0034">Thus, in a first embodiment variation, said hand operated means comprise:
<ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0046">The system <b>1</b> according to the invention and shown schematically on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an electrical rudder control system for an aircraft (not shown), in particular an airplane and especially a transport airplane. Such system <b>1</b> has no mechanical rudder control compensator.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0047">An electrical rudder control system <b>1</b> for an aircraft usually comprises:
<ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0048">a rudder bar (realized under the shape of pedals) being adapted to be operated by the pilot (pedals <b>2</b>A) or the copilot (pedals <b>2</b>B);</li>
        <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0049">means <b>3</b> being associated with said rudder bar <b>2</b>, determining its position and generating an electrical control signal being representative of such position;</li>
        <li id="ul0011-0003" num="0050">a flight control calculator <b>4</b> receiving such electrical control signal thru an electrical connection <b>5</b> and which generates, thru the latter, control orders; and</li>
        <li id="ul0011-0004" num="0051">operating means <b>6</b> for a vertical rudder <b>7</b> of the aircraft, to which this control orders are transmitted thru an electrical connection <b>8</b>. These operating means <b>6</b> deflect the vertical rudder <b>7</b> (as illustrated by a link <b>9</b> in mixed lines) by a deflection value representative of the thus received control orders.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0052">Such system <b>1</b> is so-called electrical, because the order controlled by the pilot (by operating the rudder bar <b>2</b>) is transmitted to the flight control calculator <b>4</b> under the shape of an electrical signal. Such flight control calculator <b>4</b> then uses such pilot order to determine, thru usual internal control laws, the control order being efficiently applied to the vertical rudder <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0053">The system <b>1</b> according to the invention is such that it allows, despite the absence of a mechanical rudder compensator, to meet the operational needs relative to such compensator.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0054">To do so, said system <b>1</b> comprises in addition:
<ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0055">auxiliary means (rudder trim compensation generator) <b>10</b> to generate a rudder trim compensation order under the form of an auxiliary electrical signal. Such rudder trim compensation order is also called bias RTS hereinunder; and</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0056">means (electrical connections <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>) to transmit such auxiliary electrical signal to said flight control calculator <b>4</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0057">Moreover, according to the invention, said flight control calculator <b>4</b> comprises means <b>13</b> to generate, thru both such auxiliary electrical signal and said electrical control signal, the control orders being transmitted to the operating means <b>6</b> for the vertical rudder <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0058">Such control orders are consequently calculated from an overall order corresponding to the sum of the order relative to the position of the rudder bar <b>2</b> (electrical control signal) and the compensation order (auxiliary electrical signal) generated by said auxiliary means <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0059">Thus, on the system <b>1</b> according to the invention, the necessary actions to meet the operational needs relative to a rudder compensator are not implemented by a usual mechanical compensator, that the system <b>1</b> has not, but by the generation and the application of a rudder compensation order which is transmitted (under the shape of an electrical signal) to the flight control calculator <b>4</b> which uses it to calculate the rudder control orders.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0060">Within such system <b>1</b>, the nil effort rudder bar position is thus always the neutral position of the rudder bar <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0061">The cancelation on said rudder control system <b>1</b> of any usual mechanical compensator thus generates gains on the aircraft mass, cost, installation facility, maintenance operations and overall reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0062">In a first embodiment, said auxiliary means <b>10</b> comprise automatic means <b>15</b> which comprise;
<ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0063">usual means <b>16</b> to automatically detect a failure in an engine of the aircraft;</li>
        <li id="ul0015-0002" num="0064">means <b>17</b> which are connected by a link <b>18</b> to said means <b>16</b> and which are formed so as to automatically determine an optimal sideslip angle; and</li>
        <li id="ul0015-0003" num="0065">means (not shown) which are preferably integrated into the calculator <b>4</b> to take such optimal sideslip angle into account.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0066">To do so, such optimal sideslip angle is added to a sideslip being controlled (corresponding to the rudder bar order) and the so-obtained sum is then converted into a rudder control order, which allows (by taking such optimal sideslip angle into account) to compensate the yawing moment generated by the failure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0067">Preferably, but not exclusively, said auxiliary means <b>10</b> are integrated into the calculator <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0068">This first embodiment applies then to cases of an engine failure. However, it could also be applied for an automatic compensation for an aircraft dissymmetry having another reason than an engine failure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0069">The means <b>17</b> use a developed normal side law, so-called Y* law. This usual law, which masters the sideslip of the aircraft at the above mentioned optimal sideslip angle, is able to automatically block the yawing moment generated by the failure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0070">With this first embodiment, in the case of an engine failure, the crew does not need anymore to provide a constant muscular effort on the vertical rudder <b>2</b> and a mechanical compensation function is not necessary anymore.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0071">However, to take the situation of piloting laws being degraded (Y* law not available further to equipment failures for example) into account, said auxiliary means <b>10</b> also comprise hand operated means <b>19</b>A, <b>19</b>B to allow a pilot to control (that is to say to select hand operation) a compensation order being transmitted to the control means.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0072">Such hand operated means <b>19</b>A, <b>19</b>B which are relative to a second embodiment of the invention, can be used instead of or in addition to automatic means <b>15</b> of said first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0073">Upon an engine failure, both embodiments can thus be used together or separately. In particular, upon a failure of the yawing moment automatic compensation (first embodiment), the pilot can use the second embodiment to perform a hand operated control.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0074">In the case of an engine failure, the control by the pilot of a compensation order according to the invention (bias RTS) equal to the required rudder bar position enables to release the rudder bar <b>2</b> at the neutral position with no muscular effort.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0075">Considering BTGT as the necessary order to compensate for an engine failure being detected, the situation shown in the following table are obtained in that case.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0078">In those last cases, instead for the pilot to compensate for dissymmetry by an action to the rudder bar <b>2</b>, he compensates it directly by an action on the control of the bias RTS value.</p>
