      <p>An apparatus for supporting a tablet includes a case for receiving the tablet. A swivel
         includes a socket and a ball disposed and retained therein. The ball is selectively
         rotatable relative to the socket. The ball is coupled to the case and the socket is
         coupled to a mounting post. The mounting post is releasably fixed to a mounting bar.
         The mounting bar defines a mounting slot configured to fix the apparatus relative
         to a structure, such as a microphone stand or the like. The apparatus includes clamping
         mechanisms to enable a user to selectively fix and release the components of the apparatus
         such that a user can configure and fix the apparatus to a desired position for interfacing
         with the tablet, and then lock the apparatus in that desired position.

         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an apparatus for supporting a tablet. Additionally,

         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">A tablet computer, or simply a tablet, is a mobile computer with display, circuitry
            and battery in a single unit. Tablets are equipped with sensors, such as a camera,
            microphone, accelerometer, and touchscreen. Tablets may include physical buttons,
            e.g., to control basic features such as speaker volume and power and ports for network
            communications and to charge the battery. An on-screen, pop-up virtual keyboard may
            be used for typing. Tablets are typically larger than smart phones at 7 inches or
            larger, measured diagonally. Apple, Inc., for example, sells a popular line of tablets
            under the brand name iPad.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tablets are used in a variety of applications including the display of music, the
            provision of controls for monitoring and adjusting recording equipment or electronic
            instruments, the display of reading material, and the display of video, to name just
            a few examples. During use, the tablet is typically held in the user's hand(s) or
            supported on a flat surface. It is known in the art to receive a tablet in a case.
            Some known cases are configurable to support the tablet in different positions, for
            example upright on table, to facilitate use of the tablet.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">As disadvantage of known cases for supporting tablets is that they do not provide
            a good solution for certain activities, particularly when a user must simultaneously
            use her hands for another task. For example, during a musical performance a guitar
            player may stand on a stage. A disadvantage of known cases is that they do not provide
            a sufficient support for the tablet because it may be too far from the performer,
            or in an inconvenient position.
         </p>
      </div>

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention resides in one aspect in an apparatus for supporting a tablet.
            The apparatus comprises a case configured to receive a tablet, the case having a receiving
            plate. A swivel comprising a socket and a ball disposed and retained in the socket,
            the ball being rotatable relative to the socket and having a stud extending from a
            surface of the ball. A distal end of the stud is coupled to the receiving plate. A
            mounting post extends along a longitudinal axis between a first end and a second end.
            The first end of the mounting post is coupled to the swivel. A mounting bar extends
            along a longitudinal axis between a first end and a second end. The mounting bar defines
            an elliptical outer surface in a cross sectional plane perpendicular to the longitudinal
            axis. The mounting bar is hollow and has an inside diameter and an outside diameter.
            The mounting bar defines a through hole proximate to the second end. The second end
            of the mounting post is received in the through hole and is releasably fixed relative
            thereto.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">The mounting bar in the above embodiment defines a mounting slot proximate to the
            first end. The mounting slot comprises a bottom surface and a first radius of curvature
            extending from the bottom surface. The first radius of curvature has a first bearing
            edge defining a first elliptically enveloping surface and a second bearing edge defining
            a second elliptically enveloping surface. The first bearing edge and the second bearing
            edge converge to a leading edge. The leading edge is configured to facilitate retention
            of an item received in the mounting slot against the first and second bearing edges.
            The mounting bar further comprising a first clamping mechanism, a portion of which
            extends into the first end of the mounting bar towards the first radius of curvature
            of the mounting slot. The first clamping mechanism is configured to engage an item
            having an elliptical outer surface positioned in the mounting slot, thereby urging
            the elliptical outer surface of the item against the first radius of curvature to
            releasably fix the mounting bar relative to the item by urging the item against the
            bearing edges and the leading edge.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment of the present invention, the first clamping mechanism comprises
            a knob and a threaded shaft extending therefrom. The shaft is threadably engaged with
            the first end of the mounting bar and extends along an axis parallel to the longitudinal
            axis of the mounting bar. A distal end of the shaft extends into the mounting slot.
            A rotation of the knob of the first clamping mechanism relative to the mounting bar
            in a first direction translates the distal end of the shaft toward the first radius
            curvature of the mounting slot. A rotation of the knob of the first clamping mechanism
            relative to the mounting bar in a second direction translates the distal end of the
            shaft away from the first radius of curvature of the mounting slot.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment of the present invention, a push pad is coupled to a distal
            end of the shaft of the first clamping mechanism. The push pad defines an elliptical
            surface configured to engage an item received in the mounting slot.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another embodiment, an inside surface the mounting bar defines a guide slot
            extending along a length of the mounting bar proximate to the push pad. The push pad
            comprises a tab that is configured to travel in the guide slot when the push pad is
            translated along the longitudinal axis of the mounting bar via a rotation of the knob
            in the first or second direction.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a second clamping mechanism is
            coupled proximate to the second end of the mounting bar. The second clamping mechanism
            is configured to releasably fix the mounting post relative to the mounting bar. The
            second clamping mechanism comprises a knob and a shaft extending therefrom, the shaft
            is threadably engaged with the second end of the mounting bar and extends along an
            axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the mounting bar. A distal end of the shaft
            extends into the through hole. A rotation of the knob of the second clamping mechanism
            relative to the mounting bar in a first direction translates the distal end of the
            shaft into the through hole to inhibit movement of the mounting post relative to the
            mounting bar. A rotation of the knob of the second clamping mechanism relative to
            the mounting bar in a second direction translates the distal end of the shaft away
            from through hole to facilitate movement of the mounting post relative to the mounting
            bar.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a third clamping mechanism is
            configured to selectively fix rotation of the ball relative to the socket. The third
            clamping mechanism comprises a knob and a shaft extending therefrom. The shaft is
            threadably engaged with the socket. A rotation of the knob of the third clamping mechanism
            relative to the socket in a first direction translates the distal end of the shaft
            into the socket to inhibit rotation of the ball relative to the socket. A rotation
            of the knob of the third clamping mechanism relative to the socket in a second direction
            translates the distal end of the shaft out of the socket to facilitate rotation of
            the ball relative to the socket.

            as substantially described above. In this embodiment, the mounting post is omitted
            and the second end of the mounting bar is coupled to the swivel.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention resides in yet another aspect in a mounting bar that extends
            along a longitudinal axis between a first end and a second end. The mounting bar defines
            an elliptical outer surface in a cross sectional plane perpendicular to the longitudinal
            axis. The mounting bar is hollow and has an inside diameter and an outside diameter.
            The mounting bar defines a mounting slot proximate to the first end. The mounting
            slot comprises a bottom surface and a first radius of curvature extending from the
            bottom surface. The first radius of curvature has a first bearing edge defining a
            first elliptically enveloping surface and a second bearing edge defining a second
            elliptically enveloping surface. The first bearing edge and the second bearing edge
            converge to a leading edge. The leading edge is configured to facilitate retention
            of an item received in the mounting slot against the first and second bearing edges.
            The mounting bar further comprising a first clamping mechanism, a portion of which
            extends into the first end of the mounting bar towards the first radius of curvature
