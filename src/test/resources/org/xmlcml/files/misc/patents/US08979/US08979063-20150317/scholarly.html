      <p>Failsafe apparatus for use with linear actuators are disclosed. A failsafe apparatus
         for use with a linear actuator includes a spring to urge a first stem of a device
         to be operated by the linear actuator toward a failsafe position and a clutch to operatively
         couple a second stem of the linear actuator to the first stem. The clutch includes
         a frame coupled to one of the first stem or the second stem and jaws moveably coupled
         to the frame. The jaws are to engage the other one of the first stem or the second
         stem to enable the linear actuator to operate the device and to disengage the other
         one of the first stem or the second stem to enable the spring to move the first stem
         toward the failsafe position.

         <h1>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates generally to linear actuators and, more particularly, to failsafe
            apparatus for use with linear actuators.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electric linear actuators are often used to operate devices such as flow control members
            in valves. Typically, a stem of a linear actuator is coupled to a stem of a device
            such as a valve. If the linear actuator loses electrical power, the linear actuator
            may maintain its last position and hold the stem of the device in an undesirable position.
            Backup power systems may be used to drive a motor of the linear actuator to move the
            stem of the device to a failsafe position. However, these backup power systems can
            fail without notice, have temperature limitations, and create ignition hazards.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">An example failsafe apparatus for use with a linear actuator includes a frame coupled
            to one of a first stem of a device to be operated by the linear actuator or a second
            stem of the linear actuator. The example failsafe apparatus further includes a first
            jaw and a second jaw. Each jaw is moveably coupled to the frame, and the jaws are
            to engage or disengage the other one of the first stem or the second stem. A spring
            is to urge the first stem toward a failsafe position. The spring moves the first stem
            toward the failsafe position when the jaws disengage the other one of the first stem
            or the second stem.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another example failsafe apparatus for use with a linear actuator includes a spring
            to urge a first stem of a device to be operated by the linear actuator toward a failsafe
            position and a clutch to operatively couple a second stem of the linear actuator to
            the first stem. The clutch includes a frame coupled to one of the first stem or the
            second stem and jaws moveably coupled to the frame. The jaws are to engage the other
            one of the first stem or the second stem to enable the linear actuator to operate
            the device and to disengage the other one of the first stem or the second stem to
            enable the spring to move the first stem toward the failsafe position.

         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another example failsafe apparatus for use with a linear actuator includes means for
            urging a first stem of a device to be operated by the linear actuator toward a failsafe
            position. The example failsafe apparatus also includes means for operatively coupling
            a second stem of the linear actuator to the first stem. The means for operatively
            coupling includes means for supporting means for engaging. The means for supporting
            is coupled to one of the first stem or the second stem. The means for engaging are
            to engage the other one of the first stem or the second stem to enable the linear
            actuator to operate the device and to disengage the second stem to enable the means

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">While the following example failsafe apparatus for use with linear actuators are described
            in conjunction with electric linear actuators and valves, the example failsafe apparatus
            may also be used with any other linear actuators and any other devices (e.g., a damper).
            Electric linear actuators are often used to operate devices. For example, an electric
            linear actuator may be used to move a flow control member of a valve between a first
            position (e.g., an open position) and a second position (e.g., a closed position).
            The electric linear actuator may include an electric motor, a transmission (e.g.,
            a gear train), and an actuator stem (e.g., a driveshaft). The actuator stem is typically
            rigidly coupled (e.g., via a nut) to a valve stem, which is coupled to the flow control
            member.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">Occasionally, an electric linear actuator suffers a loss of electrical power. Without
            electrical power, the motor in the actuator seizes or maintains its last position,
            which arrests the movement of the actuator stem and may cause the flow control member
            to be suspended in an undesirable position. Therefore, backup power sources (e.g.,
            batteries, capacitors, etc.) are often coupled to the electric motors of linear actuators.
            A backup power source typically provides the electric motor with temporary electrical
            power (e.g., to move the actuator stem to a failsafe position) until the electrical
            power outage is resolved. However, these backup power sources often fail without notice,
            have temperature limitations, and create ignition hazards.

         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">Example failsafe apparatus for use with linear actuators described herein move a stem
            of a device operated by a linear actuator to a failsafe position (e.g., fully open,
            fully closed, etc.) without providing electrical power to the motor of the linear
            actuator. An example failsafe apparatus described herein includes a spring to urge
            a first stem of a device to be operated by a linear actuator toward a failsafe position
            and a clutch to operatively couple a second stem of the linear actuator to the first
            stem. The clutch includes a frame, and a first jaw and a second jaw are moveably coupled
            (e.g., pivotably coupled, slidably coupled, etc.) to the frame. The frame is coupled
            to one of the first stem or the second stem. The jaws engage the other one of first
            stem or the second stem to enable the linear actuator to operate the device and disengage
            the other one of the first stem or second stem to enable the spring to move the first
            stem toward the failsafe position. An actuator (e.g., a solenoid) may be positioned
            between respective ends of the jaws to urge the jaws into engagement with the other
            one of the first stem or the second stem. The clutch may also include a second spring
            to urge the jaws to disengage the other one of the first stem or the second stem.
            When the actuator stops urging the jaws to engage the other one of the first stem
            or the second stem, the second spring moves the jaws to disengage the jaws from the
            other one of the first stem or the second stem, and the spring urges the first stem
            to a failsafe position.
