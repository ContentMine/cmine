      <div>
         <h1>FIELD OF INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to crushing devices and, more particularly, to a design
            for a concrete crusher, which includes a concrete gyratory shell.
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gyratory crushers (or cone crushers) are well established machines that are used for
            crushing rocks, ore, and other materials. They are very large and their basic structure
            comprises a bowl shaped as a cone with the wider end of the cone near the top of the
            crusher. A conical head assembly is located on the axis of the bowl, and the head
            assembly is oriented so that its smaller dimension is at the top of the crusher. To
            perform the crushing action, independent motions are applied to the conical head assembly.
            The first is rotation and the second is gyration.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the typical gyratory crusher, large material is fed into the top between the large
            opening of the bowl and the small end of the head assembly where the volume is largest.
            The gyration of the head assembly is furnished by an eccentric drive, the rotation
            is driven by a gear, and vertical support and minor vertical adjustment is furnished
            by a hydraulic support. All these parts are located at the bottom of the crusher at
            the bottom of the conical head assembly. The combination of the rotation and the gyration
            applies forces that crush the pieces of material, and they fall lower into the reduced
            space within the bowl as they are reduced in size. Ultimately the material leaves
            the crusher through openings at the bottom of the crusher.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical gyratory crusher has a thick metal shell that is typically cast. It can
            be appreciated that these large castings can require long lead times, and a result
            only a limited number of potential suppliers are available. In addition, the thick
            metal shell is expensive.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a concrete gyratory shell
            can be used to replace a significant portion of the casting needed. It can be appreciated
            that a concrete gyratory shell can replace the thick metal shell, and which is easier
            to manufacture, at a lower cost and with reduced lead time.
         </p>

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a gyratory crusher comprises: a bowl shaped
            as a cone and having a wider opening approaching a top portion of the crusher, and
            wherein the bowl has an inner shell, which is backed by a concrete outer shell; a
            head assembly shaped as a cone, centrally located within the bowl and having a larger
            diameter at a bottom end portion of the bowl, so that the bowl and head assembly form
            a crushing volume which is larger at the top portion and smaller at the bottom end,
            with the head assembly including a central mainshaft which is located on an inclined
            axis within the bowl; and a cylindrical eccentric assembly including an eccentric
            central volume in which the main shaft is held so that, as the eccentric assembly
            rotates, the mainshaft gyrates, with the eccentric assembly rotating about a center
            hole within a central hub of the crusher.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, a method of making or retrofitting
            a gyratory crusher comprises: forming a concrete outer shell shaped as a cone and
            having a wider opening approaching a top portion of the outer concrete shell; and
            lining the concrete outer shell with a fabricated form.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PRESENT PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</h1>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a gyratory crusher 
            <b>100</b> includes a bowl 
            <b>110</b> comprised of an inner shell 
            <b>111</b>, which is backed by a concrete shell 
            <b>114</b>. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the concrete shell 
            <b>114</b> is lined with a plurality of fabricated forms 
            <b>112</b>. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the plurality of fabricated forms are
            a plurality of thin metal plates or shells 
            <b>116</b>. It can be appreciated that by replacing the outer metal shell or casting with a
            plurality of thin metal plates (or shells) 
            <b>116</b> and an outer concrete shell 
            <b>114</b>, the bowl 
            <b>110</b> of the gyratory shell is easier to manufacture based on the use of concrete or other
            materials. In addition, the bowl 
            <b>110</b> can be manufactured at a lower cost and with reduced lead times. In addition, by
            using a concrete shell 
            <b>114</b> lined with thin metal plates (or shells) 
            <b>116</b>, the size of the gyratory crusher 
            <b>110</b> is also no longer limited to the largest castable shell.

         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">figref[FIG. 1]
            	 is a cross sectional view of a preferred embodiment of concrete gyratory crusher
            
            <b>100</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. As shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	, the concrete gyrator crusher 
            <b>100</b> includes bowl or shell 
            <b>110</b> shaped as a cone with its wider opening at the top, and head assembly 
            <b>120</b> which is located on the axis of bowl 
            <b>110</b>. The head assembly 
            <b>120</b> is shaped as a cone and has its larger diameter at the lower end of bowl 
            <b>110</b> so that together the bowl 
            <b>110</b> and the head assembly 
            <b>120</b> form crushing volume, which is larger at the top and smaller at the lower end. This
            configuration permits larger material to be fed into the top of crusher 
            <b>100</b>, and which falls to the bottom of bowl 
            <b>110</b> as it is crushed into smaller pieces and exits the crusher 
            <b>100</b>. Typically, both the bowl 
            <b>110</b> and the head assembly 
            <b>120</b> have replaceable working surfaces. The bowl 
            <b>110</b> has a liner (not shown), called a “concave” in the industry, and head assembly 
            <b>120</b> has a liner (not shown) referred to as a “mantle”.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the head assembly 
            <b>120</b> is located adjacent to an eccentric assembly 
            <b>130</b> which is rotated by a ring gear 
            <b>124</b>. The eccentric assembly 
            <b>130</b>, within which the lower portion of a mainshaft 
            <b>134</b> is held, imparts to the head assembly 
            <b>120</b> an eccentric motion, essentially a gyration, for the crusher 
            <b>100</b> to function. The motion is imparted to the head assembly 
            <b>120</b> by the eccentric assembly 
            <b>130</b> that has an eccentric center volume, although the eccentric assembly 
            <b>130</b> is itself cylindrical and mounted in a centered cylindrical support hole within a
            center hub. The eccentric assembly 
            <b>130</b> along with annular shell 
            <b>132</b>, are part of the bottom support structure of crusher 
            <b>100</b>. The eccentric assembly 
            <b>130</b> rotates about a center hole and, as eccentric assembly 
            <b>130</b> rotates, its eccentric center volume moves the bottom end of mainshaft in an eccentric
            path imparting the gyratory motion to head assembly 
            <b>120</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">The mainshaft 
            <b>134</b> of the head assembly 
            <b>120</b> fits into and is attached to the eccentric assembly 
            <b>130</b>, and, at the top of the crusher 
            <b>100</b>, the mainshaft 
            <b>134</b> is located by bushings or bearings within a spider (or spider device) 
            <b>140</b>. The spider (or spider device) 
            <b>140</b> is the upper support member of the crusher 
            <b>100</b>. The eccentric assembly 
            <b>130</b> and the mainshaft 
            <b>134</b> are supported from below the eccentric assembly 
            <b>130</b> by a hydraulic support assembly 
            <b>132</b>. The hydraulic support assembly 
            <b>132</b> is typically comprised of a cylindrical support and a piston assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment as shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	, the bowl (or shell) 
            <b>110</b> is comprised of a plurality of prefabricated (or fabricated) forms 
            <b>112</b>, which are preferably in the form of a thin metal shells or plates 
            <b>116</b>. The plurality of prefabricated forms 
            <b>112</b> are backed with a concrete outer shell 
            <b>114</b> for support. The fabricated forms 
            <b>112</b> also can include an anchor or other means of attaching to the fabricated forms 
            <b>112</b> to the concrete outer shell 
            <b>114</b>. In addition, the fabricated forms 
            <b>112</b> are preferably lined with wear resistant castings (or concaves) 
            <b>118</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the thin metal shell or plates
