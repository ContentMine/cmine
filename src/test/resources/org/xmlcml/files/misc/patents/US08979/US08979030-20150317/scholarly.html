         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to packs and methods and systems for manufacturing the
            packs. More particularly, the invention is directed to cost-effective packs adapted
            to be distributed from an aircraft and methods and systems for manufacturing the packs.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background</p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous circumstances require the transport and delivery of various kinds of cargo
            to inaccessible or remote areas where ground transportation is not possible or timely.
            For example, in the event that people are trapped or disabled in a remote area, a
            hostile environment, or an area ravaged by a natural disaster, it may become necessary
            or desirable to supply them with food, water, medicine, shelter, and other supplies
            as rapidly as possible. Similarly, in times of warfare, battlefields may be in remote
            locations or hostile environments. Likewise, it may be necessary to deliver supplies
            such as fuel to stranded people. Of course, in times of war or other hostilities,
            it may be essential to provide support to permit the stranded personnel to evacuate
            the position in which they find themselves.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many remote locations or hostile environments may be in areas such as deserts or large
            expanses of otherwise uninhabited or inhospitable terrain. Because of the remoteness
            of a location or its inaccessibility, supplies are often delivered by air drops from
            airplanes or helicopters. In the event of natural disasters and other emergencies,
            time may be of the essence to deliver sustenance, medicine, or other critical items
            to people cut off from life-sustaining supplies. For example, it might be essential
            to provide water to people cut off from a clean water supply in the event of flooding,
            an earthquake, and/or a hurricane.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">While in an emergency, the cost of packaging and delivering supplies to those in need
            may be considered secondary, it is nevertheless important to provide packaging for
            the supplies that can be formed and distributed on a reasonably cost-effective basis.
            Also, the space taken up by the containers or packages, as well as the amount and
            cost of material from which the containers are fabricated, should be minimized to
            increase the cost effectiveness thereof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the past, relief supplies have been delivered by dropping pallets of supplies by
            parachutes connected to containers. Typically, large amounts of supplies are stacked
            on multiple pallets and parachutes are connected to the pallets. However, parachutes
            are expensive and are typically not recoverable. Moreover, the parachutes may be quite
            large and cumbersome. The size of the parachutes depends on the particular supplies
            to be distributed. If the parachutes are undersized, the containers descend at a rapid
            rate and the container may be ruptured and the contents thereof lost, or people on
            the ground may be harmed by the rapidly-descending containers. Furthermore, if the
            supplies are stacked together on a pallet and the pallet air drop is off target, the
            supplies may be unrecoverable by those in need. Even if the pallet of supplies is
            recoverable, bandits or guerillas have been known to hoard the supplies and either
            keep them from people in need or ransom the supplies.

         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a continuing need for a cost-effective package for emergency supplies that
            may be easily air dropped and distributed to a large number of people with a minimized
            risk of damage to the supplies and harm to the people collecting the supplies. Additionally,
            there is a continuing need for a method and system for manufacturing the packages.

         <p id="p-0055" num="0054">Providing supplies to a population under emergency conditions is an extremely risky
            undertaking. Typically, transportation infrastructures have been disrupted, for example,
            by natural disasters or political or social upheaval. It is often difficult or impossible
            to truck relief supplies to the disaster area because roads are destroyed and/or access
            points are blocked. In addition, the relief workers themselves are placed in danger,
            which may be from environmental concerns (e.g. floods, mudslides, earthquakes, radiation)
            or dangerous military actions on the ground. Providing supplies by air is often the
            only viable option in a disaster, but there are still many problems. Because supplies
            are provided in bulk, the process generally requires precise targeting and coordination
            with those on the ground to avoid damage to the supplies themselves, damage to structures
            on the ground, and harm to persons and animals. Whether delivered by truck, ship,
            or aircraft, supplies are often stolen or confiscated by governments or persons wishing
            to establish regional political or military dominance. Consequently, the cost of delivery
            is high and the effectiveness of providing real relief is minimal.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0056" num="0055">It has been surprisingly discovered that a cost-effective pack of supplies can be
            manufactured and air dropped for distribution to large numbers of people with a minimized
            risk of damage to structures on the ground, to the supplies themselves, and with minimal
            risk of harm to people and animals on the ground, all while maximizing the receipt
            of supplies to those in need. Whereas conventional delivery methods typically maximize
            the quantity delivered, such as bulk delivery by truck, ship, or air, the invention
            described herein is directed to delivering large numbers of low-weight packs by air
            so that the packs are distributed evenly and randomly over a large predetermined area.
            Delivering large numbers packs over a region makes it difficult or impossible for
            all supplies to be stolen or otherwise sequestered by individuals who are not the
            intended recipients. This effectively destroys the black market potential that can
            be created when supplies are delivered in bulk, whether that delivery is by truck,
            ship or air, and, more importantly, maximizes the quantity of supplies received by
            the targeted persons.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, each pack is configured as a single delivery unit and packs are delivered
            in large numbers, so the risk of supplies not reaching the intended victims or being
            otherwise stolen is minimized. As aspect on the invention is therefore the rapid construction
            and assembly of packs in large numbers. Single station, and semi automated manufacturing
            apparatus are configured to produce thousands to tens of thousands of packs per day.
            Packs preferably contain one or only a few rations of the supplies such as, for example,
            food, water, or medicine. Although the supply lasts for a short time, because costs
            are minimized, deliveries can be repeated many times and with minimal risk to those
            involved. Importantly, because packs are delivered by air, relief workers never need
            to enter the disaster area itself. Also, depending on the aerodynamic components of
            the pack, distribution can be from almost any altitude, again keeping relief workers
            safe from danger.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0058" num="0057">Packs are capable of being distributed or broadcast over a wide area or targeted to
            a precise or limited location, again so as to minimize the risk of theft and/or to
            reach a target area that is itself limited or small. The range is preferably pre-determined
            so as to maximize distribution to individuals in need as compared to palette distribution
            by truck, air, or ship.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0059" num="0058">Packs are configured to possess an aerodynamic component to reduce or eliminate acceleration
            produced by gravity. Because pack weights are small as compared to bulk supplies,
            the aerodynamic component is correspondingly minimized. Preferably the packs themselves
            are aerodynamically designed so that the rate at which the packs fall to the ground
            is minimized as compared to freefall. Preferably the packs hit the ground at speeds
            that pose little to no risk of damage to structures, other things on the ground, or
            the contents of the packs themselves, and little to no risk of harm from to persons
            or animals (i.e. from the pack landing on a person or animal during descent). The
            rate and speed are precisely controlled by the aerodynamic component of the pack itself
            by introducing one or more drag and/or lift elements. Drag can be induced from lift
            or parasitic as a consequence of the structure of the component. Aerodynamic components
            that can be added include, but are not limited to one or more wings, fins, tail structures,
            propellers or rotary blades, airfoils, sails or parasails, streamers, tunnels, dimples,
            vent slits, scalloped edges, serrated edges and parachutes. Preferably, wings or airfoils
            are configured to force the pack to circle or oscillate while descending so as to
            localize pack delivery to a limited area. While weather conditions can still be problematic,
            when known or predicted in advance, specific aerodynamic components can be configured
            by one skilled in the art to adjust the trajectory of the packs and therefore account
            for expected transverse movement of the pack through the air while descending. Also,
            pack distribution can be monitored by radar (e.g. doppler) or tracking devices within
            each pack (e.g. GPS) to plot broadcast distribution patterns over various terrain
            and in various weather conditions. Those patterns can be used to determine optimal
            distribution or determine if re-distribution is necessary. Design configurations may
            include, for example, ailerons and rudder structures that may be fixed to predetermined
            positions, wings and/or leading edges set at a predetermined shape or angle of attack,
            asymmetric loading of the supplies in the pack itself and/or combinations thereof.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0060" num="0059">Preferably, packs, including the aerodynamic components, are manufactures as single
            units to minimize manufacturing costs. Also preferable, supply items are inserted
            into the packs during the manufacturing process, again to minimize costs.

            <b>14</b> is formed from a high performance barrier plastic. For example, the high performance
            barrier plastic can be an oxygen or carbon dioxide scavenger or barrier. Additionally,
            outer package 
            <b>14</b> may be made of numerous layers. For example, outer package

            package 
            <b>14</b> and decrease a descent rate of the pack 
            <b>10</b> in operation. Preferably, the velocity of pack

            <b>10</b> are conveyed from the containers and out of the airplane so that the packs

            <b>10</b> from the other packs 
            <b>10</b> is achieved.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0084" num="0083">It has also been surprisingly discovered that when a plurality of packs 
            <b>10</b>, as shown in figref[FIGS. 1-10]

            substantially all of the packs 
            <b>10</b> are oriented with the aerodynamic component 
            <b>32</b>, 
            <b>34</b> between the sheet 
            <b>18</b> and the ground. Such orientation results in the aerodynamic component 
            <b>32</b>, 
            <b>34</b> being caught by the air and extending outwardly to minimize a terminal velocity of
            the packs 
            <b>10</b>. The orientation of the aerodynamic component 
            <b>32</b>, 
            <b>34</b> further advantageously results in a random and even distribution of the packs 
            <b>10</b> across the ground above which the packs

         </p>
         <p id="p-0085" num="0084">Due to the size of the packs

            <b>10</b> are formed, the packs 
            <b>10</b> are adapted to reach a desired peak terminal velocity that is sufficiently low such
            that the pack 
            <b>10</b> does not harm people or property on the ground. As discussed herein, the size, weight,
            and nature of the contents of the packs 
            <b>10</b> will dictate the materials used to form the inner and outer packages

            <b>10</b> provide rigidity to militate against the bending or folding of the pack 
            <b>10</b> during the aerial distribution. By militating against bending or folding, the surface
            area of the pack

            the terminal velocity of the pack 
            <b>10</b>. In addition, packs can be created with no or minimal angles for low radar observance.
            Angles can be rounded or, preferably eliminated. Preferred structures for packs may

            <b>10</b>. In particular, the wing band sealing unit 
            <b>112</b> may include a pair of heated sealing bands 
            <b>150</b>, 
            <b>152</b> that compress and heat the folded edges to form wing seals. The wing band sealing
            unit 
            <b>112</b> simultaneously forms the drag elements and side sealing edges of the packs 
            <b>10</b>. It should be understood that the aerodynamic elements or “wings” of the packs 
            <b>10</b> are closed as formed, but open in operation, as the pack 
            <b>10</b> is falling through the air.

            	, the system 
            <b>100</b> further may include a package separator unit 
            <b>114</b>. The package separator unit 
            <b>114</b> is disposed adjacent the wing band sealing unit 
            <b>112</b>, for example. The package separator unit 
            <b>114</b> may include a guillotine 
            <b>154</b>. The guillotine 
            <b>154</b> is configured to cut along at least a portion of the perforation formed by the perforator
            unit 
            <b>108</b> and thereby separates each pack 
            <b>10</b>. The guillotine 
            <b>154</b> thereby forms individual ones of the pack 
            <b>10</b>. As the packs 
            <b>10</b> exit the system 
            <b>100</b>, the packs 
            <b>10</b> are collected and stored for transport and distribution. The packs 
            <b>10</b> may be collected in a container with no organization to the packs 
            <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the packs 
            <b>10</b> may be collected in an organized manner resulting in stacked packs 
            <b>10</b>. For example, the container may be a pack magazine containing a desired number of
            packs 
            <b>10</b> stacked with the inner package of pack 
            <b>10</b> offset from the inner package of adjacent packs 
            <b>10</b>. Other means for collecting the individual packs 
            <b>10</b> may be employed, as desired.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0105" num="0104">In another embodiment, the individual packs 
            <b>10</b> are not separated by the package separator unit 
            <b>114</b>, to provide a linear “string” of packs that are separated during deployment.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0106" num="0105">The present disclosure further includes a method for manufacturing the pack 
            <b>10</b>. The method may be used with the system 
            <b>100</b> of the present disclosure, or another system, as desired. The method first includes
            the step of providing the first sheet and the at least one inner package including
            the item for aerial delivery. The inner package is then deposited on the first sheet.
            A second sheet is disposed over the inner package and the first sheet. The first sheet
            and the second sheet are then sealed to form the outer package housing the inner package.
            The at least one aerodynamic element is formed on the outer package, for example,
            adjacent the at least one inner package. The aerodynamic element preferably causes
            turbulent flow across the outer package and reduces or minimizes the descent rate
            of the pack in operation. The aerodynamic element may also reduces or minimizes the
            descent rate of the pack in operation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0107" num="0106">The step of sealing the first sheet and the second sheet may include forming a top
            edge seal, a bottom edge seal, and spaced apart side edge seals on the first sheet
            and the second sheet. The step of sealing the first sheet and the second sheet may
            also include forming a pair of mid-pack seals. The inner package is confined within
            the outer package by the pair of mid-pack seals, the top edge seal, and the bottom
            edge seal.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0108" num="0107">The step of forming the at least one aerodynamic element may include folding corresponding
            side edges of the first sheet and the second sheet. The folded edges are sealed, for
            example, between the side edge seals and the mid-pack seals, to form wing seals.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0109" num="0108">The inner package may also be coupled to the outer package of the pack 
            <b>10</b>. For example, the top edge and the bottom edge of the at least one inner package
            may be sealed between the first sheet and the second sheet with the top transverse
            seal and the bottom transverse seal. The inner package is thereby coupled to the outer
            package. Other suitable means for coupling the inner package with the outer package,
            including adhesives, fasteners, and the like, may also be employed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0110" num="0109">The pack 
            <b>10</b> of the present disclosure may also be perforated to facilitate both a separation
            of the packs 
            <b>10</b>, and an opening of individual packs 
            <b>10</b>. For example, the perforation may extend inwardly from the top edge of the pack 
            <b>10</b>. The perforation may traverse at least one of the top edge seal, the top transverse
            seal, and the bottom transverse seal, in order that the seals may be opened. Access
            to the inner package is thereby permitted.
