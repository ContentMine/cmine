            of which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.
         </p>

      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to skid landing gear and to an aircraft provided with
            such landing gear, in particular a rotorcraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">(2) Description of Related Art</p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, a rotorcraft includes landing gear via which the rotorcraft rests
            on the ground. More particularly, the landing gear may comprise so-called “skid” landing
            gear having first and second longitudinal bearing skids suitable for coming into contact
            with the ground and located on either side of the fuselage of the rotorcraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, skid landing gear is usually provided with first and second transverse
            crossbars each connected to the first and second skids in order to connect the skids
            to the airframe of the aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first crossbar is referred to as the “front” crossbar since the first crossbar
            connects the airframe to zones situated at the front ends of the first and second
            longitudinal skids. Conversely, the second crossbar is referred to as the “rear” crossbar
            insofar as the second crossbar connects the airframe to zones situated at the rear
            ends of the first and second longitudinal skids.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">The landing gear is then fastened to the aircraft via its front and rear crossbars.</p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">Such landing gear is very effective and enables a rotorcraft to land on multiple types
            of surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">Nevertheless, landing on sloping ground can be difficult, in particular for an inexperienced
            pilot.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">Using the landing procedure that is normally used when landing a helicopter on sloping
            ground, the pilot begins by hovering above the selected landing zone. The pilot then
            moves the helicopter towards the ground by reducing the collective pitch of the blades
            of the rotor until one skid touches the ground, which skid is referred to for convenience
            as the “uphill” skid.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">The pilot then continues to reduce the collective pitch, while also modifying the
            cyclic pitch of the blades so as to keep the rotor disk substantially horizontal,
            i.e. perpendicular to the gravity axis.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">It should be observed that if the slope of the ground is excessive, it is possible
            for the pilot to reach the maximum cyclic pitch of the blades, whereupon the pilot
            is obliged to take off in order to find some other landing zone.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the downhill skid touches the ground in turn, the pilot verifies the quality
            of the trim of the helicopter on the ground by gently operating the rudder bar and
            the collective pitch lever. If the trim is acceptable, then the pilot ceases to act
            on the cyclic pitch of the blades and possibly reduces the speed of rotation of the
            power plant driving the rotor. In certain situations such as unloading passengers,
            it is advisable not to reduce the speed of rotation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">It can be understood that such a procedure requires special training for pilots.</p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">Document U.S. Pat. No. 3,857,533 describes a helicopter provided with skid landing
            gear that makes it easier to land on sloping ground.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">That landing gear possesses first and second skids that are connected together by
            front and rear crossbars. Each crossbar forms a circular arc with its concave side
            facing towards the ground, the concave surface of each of the crossbars including
            blocking catches.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">The landing gear also includes guide means fastened to the helicopter airframe for
            co-operating with each of the crossbars, i.e. stationary wheels that allow the crossbars
            to move transversely when one of the skids touches the ground, with the wheels then
            revolving.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">Finally, the landing gear includes active means for blocking the crossbars, i.e. fingers
            controlled by the collective pitch control of the aircraft so as to co-operate with
            the blocking catches of the crossbars.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, when the helicopter lands on a slope, as soon as the uphill skid of the landing
            gear touches the ground, the reaction of the ground on the uphill skid causes the
            skids to move transversely. Under such circumstances, the landing gear pivots relative
            to the airframe of the helicopter.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">Such pivoting comes to an end when the downhill skid touches the ground, in turn.
            Thus, the landing gear pivots to match the slope without the airframe of the helicopter
            tending to pivot as well, thus enabling the pilot to avoid acting on the cyclic pitch
            of the blades for the purpose of keeping the lift rotor horizontal.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, by reducing the collective pitch of the blades with the collective stick
            lever, the pilot instructs the blocking means to engage in the blocking catches so
            as to prevent the airframe tilting sideways on the ground by freezing the position
            of the airframe relative to the landing gear.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">Since the rotor is kept horizontal without acting on the cyclic pitch, landing is
            simplified and made safer compared with the above-described procedure.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although effective, that landing gear requires the flight control to be coupled with
            the blocking means in order to block the landing gear on the ground. This results
            in a mechanical structure that is complicated and also in providing actuators and
            sensors, thereby running the risk of them failing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, it is found that after landing on sloping ground, the landing gear is
            off-center relative to the airframe of the helicopter and in particular relative to
            the anteroposterior plane of symmetry of the airframe. This results in unbalance of
            the aerodynamic drag of the landing gear during the flight undertaken after landing
            on sloping ground.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, the pilot has no means for estimating the position of the landing gear
            relative to the airframe, and in particular the heights of the skids relative to the
            airframe. Under such circumstances, the pilot is in a disagreeable situation next
            time a landing is to be made. Furthermore, it can be understood that the pilot runs
            the risk of catching on an obstacle while moving in translation at very low altitude.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should also be observed that the following documents are known: SE 118 333 C, FR

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">An object of the present invention is thus to propose landing gear that makes it possible
            to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks by proposing landing gear that is simple
            and that is capable of allowing the pilot to know the exact position of the skids
            of the landing gear relative to the airframe when in flight.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the invention, landing gear is provided with a first longitudinal bearing
            skid and a second longitudinal bearing skid together with a first transverse crossbar
            and a second transverse crossbar, each connected to the first and second skids in
            order to connect each longitudinal bearing skid to an airframe of an aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0031" num="0030">The landing gear is remarkable in that it includes at least one resilient fastener
            device together with at least one blocking means and at least one centering means
            per crossbar, the fastener device for the associated crossbar including connection
            means for connecting the associated crossbar to the airframe and slide means for allowing
            the associated crossbar to slide relative to the connection means in a direction parallel
            to a transverse direction from the first skid towards the second skid while landing
            on sloping terrain, the blocking means being independent and acting to block the sliding
            of the associated crossbar relative to the connection means after landing on sloping
            terrain, the centering means acting in flight to position the associated crossbar
            in a predetermined position relative to the connection means.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be observed that the term “associated crossbar” means the crossbar co-operating
            with a fastener assembly having at least one fastener device together with at least
            one blocking means and at least one centering means. Thus, the first crossbar is the
            crossbar associated with the first fastener assembly and the second crossbar is associated
            with the second fastener assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each crossbar is then resiliently connected in flight to the airframe of the aircraft
            via at least one resilient fastener device, the crossbar being connected rigidly to
            said airframe by blocking means as a result of making a landing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0034" num="0033">The fastener assembly of a crossbar may for example possess one blocking means and
            two fastener devices each co-operating with slide means, or indeed two blocking means
            and one fastener device co-operating with slide means, for example.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0035" num="0034">Under such circumstances, the invention provides a resilient fastener device that
            is suitable for allowing the crossbars and the longitudinal bearing skids to move
            after a skid has made contact with sloping ground.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0036" num="0035">Like document U.S. Pat. No. 3,857,533, such movement serves to simplify the procedure
            for landing. Nevertheless, unlike the teaching of that document U.S. Pat. No. 3,857,533,
            the invention makes provision in particular for a resilient fastener device together
            with independent blocking means, i.e. means that are independent of the flight controls
            of the aircraft, thereby enabling the installation to be simplified. Furthermore,
            the invention possesses centering means for centering the crossbars and the longitudinal
            bearing skids relative to the anteroposterior plane of symmetry of the aircraft while
            it is in flight, e.g. for the purpose of limiting the aerodynamic drag of the landing
            gear and of avoiding any pilot uncertainty about the real positions of the two skids.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0037" num="0036">Whatever the slope of the ground before making a flight, the first and second skids
            are arranged by the centering means in a position that is predetermined by the manufacturer.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0038" num="0037">The landing gear may include one or more of the following additional characteristics.</p>
         <p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the landing gear includes at least one lateral abutment arranged on a
            crossbar to limit the movement of the crossbar relative to the connection means during
            a landing on sloping terrain.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment, two lateral abutments are provided arranged on either side of a
            fastener device. Contact between a lateral abutment and a fastener device serves to
            stop lateral movement of the crossbar.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, at least one given crossbar comprises a central portion that is secured
            to a first portion secured to the first skid and a second portion secured to the second
            skid, said centering means comprising said central portion, said central portion presenting
            an arc of given radius about a center of curvature, the center of curvature being
            above said given crossbar when the landing gear is resting on horizontal ground.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">Under such circumstances, the central portion presents a concave side facing the airframe
            of the aircraft. This characteristic enables the crossbar to be re-centered automatically
            by gravity once the skids are no longer touching the ground.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the centering means may comprise transverse return means, e.g. resilient
            return means, and a lever secured to the associated crossbar, the transverse return
            means tending to move the lever in order to position the associated crossbar in the
            predetermined position.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the transverse return means may include two springs located on either
            side of the lever. When sloping ground exerts a force on the uphill skid, the crossbar
            moves relative to the airframe. This lateral movement of the crossbar stretches one
            of springs and compresses the other spring via the lever. In contrast, after the aircraft
            has taken off, each of the springs returns to its initial position, thereby moving
            the lever, and consequently returning the crossbar to said initial position.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0045" num="0044">In particular, any means equivalent to a spring, such as a block of elastomer or a
            spring blade, could be envisaged.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0046" num="0045">The lever may be combined with making use of a portion of the crossbar that has a
            center of curvature about said portion.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, the blocking means may comprise a stationary portion suitable for being
            fastened to the airframe and a movable portion secured to the associated crossbar,
            the stationary portion and the movable portion co-operating by interfering shapes
            after a landing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, the stationary portion includes catches and the movable portion includes
            teeth suitable for co-operating with the catches.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be observed that the terms “tooth” and “catch” should be understood broadly
            and cover shapes that are complementary, a “catch” having a female shape and a “tooth”
            having a male shape. A catch and/or tooth may include two sloping surfaces, or indeed
            lugs or pins, in particular.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another aspect, the connection means comprise a fastener structure suitable for
            being fastened to the airframe, the slide means comprise a stationary wheel and a
            movable wheel co-operating with the fastener structure to connect the associated crossbar
            to the airframe, the associated crossbar passing between a stationary wheel and a
            movable wheel.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0051" num="0050">In flight, the crossbar is held between a stationary wheel and a movable wheel. However,
            while landing, the movable wheel is free to move in elevation and to allow the associated
            crossbar to be blocked transversely. The fastener device is then resilient insofar
            as it deforms depending on the stage of flight.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0052" num="0051">The fastener structure may support a stationary axle for the stationary wheel and
            a movable axle for the movable wheel, which axle slides in at least one slot extending
            in elevation in the fastener structure above the stationary wheel. For example, the
            fastener structure may comprise two parallel plates having respective guide slots,
            with the stationary axle being secured to each of the plates and the movable axle
            being arranged in the slot in each of the plates.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0053" num="0052">Furthermore, the slide means may optionally include elevation return means for returning
            the movable wheel and suitable for pressing the movable wheel against the associated
            crossbar. For example, the elevation return means may comprise a spring fastened both
            to the movable axle and to the fastener structure or to the airframe. A spring blade
            or a block of elastomer material could also be envisaged.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition to landing gear, the invention provides an aircraft including such landing
            gear.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the invention, an aircraft comprises an airframe and landing gear, the
            landing gear being provided with a first longitudinal bearing skid and a second longitudinal
            bearing skid, together with first and second transverse crossbars to connect each
            longitudinal bearing skid to said airframe.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, the landing gear includes one or more of the above characteristics. In
            particular, the landing gear includes at least one resilient fastener device together
            with at least one blocking device and at least one centering means per crossbar, the
            fastener device for fastening the associated crossbar including connection means for
            connecting the associated crossbar to the airframe and slide means for allowing the
            associated crossbar to slide relative to the airframe during a landing on sloping
            terrain, the blocking means being independent to block sliding of the associated crossbar
            relative to the airframe following a landing on sloping terrain, the centering means
            acting in flight to position the associated crossbar in a predetermined position relative
            to the airframe.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, the landing gear may have two resilient fastener means on one crossbar
            and one resilient fastener means on the other crossbar in order to obtain a three-point
            fastener system, or indeed two resilient fastener means on each crossbar in order
            to obtain a four-point fastener system.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0058" num="0057">Depending on the variant, the landing gear is provided with at least two fastener
            devices associated with one crossbar and at least one fastener device associated with
            the other crossbar.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0059" num="0058">Furthermore, it should be observed that rotorcraft may be subjected to complex phenomena
            of ground resonance. The invention also presents the advantage of at least minimizing
            that phenomenon of ground resonance while landing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0060" num="0059">During an initial stage of landing, the landing gear is connected to the airframe
            via resilient fastener devices and it is not rigidly connected to the airframe until
            the last stage of the landing, in which last stage the pilot reduces the cyclic and
            collective pitch controls. The vibration generated by the rotor via the airframe therefore
            does not subject the aircraft to the ground resonance phenomenon.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0061" num="0060">The resonant frequency in roll of the helicopter when standing on its landing gear
            is very low, and may even be close to zero hertz at the beginning of a landing, while
            the vibratory excitation from the rotor is still strong, given a relatively large
            collective pitch. The resonance frequency in roll rises when the crossbars become
            blocked laterally, however the risk of ground resonance is then reduced because the
            collective pitch is greatly reduced, thereby greatly reducing the amount of vibratory
            excitation it generates.

         </p>
         <p id="p-0099" num="0098">Similarly, the movable wheel 
            <b>52</b> co-operates with the fastener structure 
            <b>41</b>. Under such circumstances, the connection means include a movable axle 
            <b>54</b> passing in succession through the first plate 
            <b>42</b> of the fastener structure, through the movable wheel 
            <b>52</b>, and then through the second plate

            <b>54</b> can slide relative to the fastener structure 
            <b>41</b>. For example, the movable axle passes through a first elongate slot 
            <b>44</b> extending substantially along the elevation direction Z in the first plate 
            <b>42</b> and through a second elongate slot

            axis.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0103" num="0102">In order to dimension the first and second slots, it should be observed that the movable
            axle is located at a first end of the first and second slots when the movable wheel
            presses the crossbar against the stationary wheel, said axle occupying a second end
            position in the first and second slots when the blocking means are engaged.

            <b>55</b> for continuously pressing the movable wheel 
            <b>52</b> against the associated crossbar. For example, the elevation return means 
            <b>55</b> possess at least one spring

         <p id="p-0105" num="0104">It can be understood that it is possible to use any other means capable of returning
            to its original shape after stress has been applied thereto, e.g. a block of elastomer.

         </p>
         <p id="p-0111" num="0110">The first force is balanced by the reaction from the fastener device, the reaction
            moment being balanced by the reactions from the set of devices for fastening a crossbar.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0112" num="0111">In contrast, the second force is not balanced, and it causes the crossbar to slide

            	, by reducing the collective pitch, the pilot causes the lift from the rotary wing
            to drop below a threshold that implies that the airframe will approach the crossbars.
            The movable wheels are then no longer capable of preventing each of the crossbars
            from moving towards the airframe along arrow F
            <b>1</b>. Thus, at the end of this approach movement, the blocking means are activated so

         <p id="p-0116" num="0115">Thus, during a first stage of landing, the movable and stationary wheels act together
