         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Within the field of the present method, system and device, the term load means any
            object able to be carried and dropped from a plane. These could be particularly drones,
            freight, etc. Preferably, a load corresponds to a piece of ammunition which, within
            the framework of the present method, system and device, means a missile or bomb type
            projectile. Preferably, such projectile is part of a usual weapon system with a military
            load and is provided with a propelling system and guiding means adapted to fly it
            and guide it toward a target to be damaged or destroyed. This can be particularly
            a guided bomb or a cruising missile.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates more precisely to a carrying and dropping system for
            a military transport plane, wherein carrying the missile is performed in the plane
            cargo compartment and dropping is implemented through an opening arranged in the back
            the plane.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous dropping systems are known, which generally use a parachute for dropping
            a piece of ammunition being carried on board. In such a case, the parachute being
            fastened to the piece of ammunition is in general inflated in the back of the plane
            so as to bring the piece of ammunition toward the back outside the plane.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, the document DE-103 42 565 discloses a missile carrying and dropping
            system being provided on a transport plane. Such system comprises a container being
            arranged in the cargo compartment and being able to receive a plurality of missiles.
            Such missiles are mounted within the container so as be able to slide with respect
            to said container which is fastened inside the plane. Moreover, a parachute is fastened
            to the back of each of said missiles. In this case, to implement a missile dropping,
            the following steps are made:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>the doors of the back cargo compartment of the plane are opened;</li>
                     
                     <li>the parachute being fastened to the missile to be dropped is expanded outside the
                        plane;
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>while inflating, such parachute retains the missile which is ejected backwards through
                        sliding in said container; and
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>when the missile is completely ejected from the plane, it is released from the parachute,
                        and it can be then propelled and guided as usual.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0011">The dropping solutions with a parachute have numerous disadvantages, including:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>a large slowing down of the piece of ammunition after dropping. In fact, the military
                        transport planes are limited in velocity (generally around Vc=200/250 knots) upon
                        a flight with the cargo compartment being open. The use of a parachute for extracting
                        the piece of ammunition involves a quasi-nil velocity after dropping. Now, the present
                        ammunition is dimensioned to be fired from fighters at high velocities (close to M=0.8-0.9
                        (Vc&gt;400 knots)) without slowing down after dropping. The low velocity of the piece
                        of ammunition after dropping suffers from problems of pilotability, engine start for
                        cruising missiles, as well as a strong range reduction for guided bombs and small
                        missiles. Consequently, the use of initially dimensioned ammunition for dropping from
                        fighters makes the integration of a re-acceleration system necessary;

                     <li>a risk of collision at the cargo compartment exit. In fact, the lower cargo compartment
                        door is horizontal upon a flight dropping. The piece of ammunition should then run
                        over a distance equivalent to the door length (5 to 6 meters) before exiting from
                        the plane area. This last disadvantage reduces the fields of use (limitation of the
                        acceptable meteorological conditions);
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>the integration on the piece of ammunition of a holding point allowing both the piece
                        of ammunition to exit in a balanced way and the acceleration efforts to be supported.
                        Moreover, it should be anticipated to provide a safety system allowing for the parachute
                        dropping if the piece of ammunition stays jammed; and
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>a lack of discretion upon the parachute dropping, once the piece of ammunition is
                        ejected. In fact, the parachute is not recovered after dropping, which can allow for
                        enemy troops to identify the origin of a shoot.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>

         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0016">Consequently, the use of a parachute upon a dropping is complicated to be implemented
            and needs heavy modifications for adapting it to usual (missiles and bombs) ammunition.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0017">The present method, system and device aim at obviating such disadvantages. It relates
            to a load carrying and dropping system for a transport plane, allowing, with no use
            of a parachute, for a secure dropping and with a reduced cost and being easily adaptable
            for any type of transport plane.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0018">With this end in view, according to the present method, system and device, said carrying
            and dropping system of the type comprising at least one container being arranged in
            the cargo compartment of the plane and being able to receive at least one load being
            mounted within said container through sliding means, is remarkable in that said container
            is arranged within said cargo compartment so as to be able to be moved longitudinally
            and to be brought from one to the other of the following positions:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>one carrying position, wherein it is completely located inside the cargo compartment;
                        and
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>one dropping position, wherein it is offset longitudinally toward the back of the
                        aircraft with respect to said carrying position, so that a part of said container,
                        the dropping part is then located outside the transport plane through an opening at
                        the back of the cargo compartment, and
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0021">in that said sliding means are formed so as to be able to bring said load in said
            dropping part, where it can be dropped when said container is in said dropping position.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0022">So, thanks to the present method, system and device, a part of the container (dropping
            part), where a load can be brought, can be moved outside the transport plane. Such
            load can then be dropped with no use of extraction means and, in particular, with
            no use of a parachute, which allows particularly to remedy to the above mentioned
            important disadvantages relative to a dropping with a parachute.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0023">In particular, thanks to the present method, system and device, the following advantages
            are specifically obtained:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>a lack of slowing down for the load after dropping, which allows, in the case of a
                        missile, to stay in the pilotability field of the missile and the engine starting.
                        In this situation, the integration of a missile re-acceleration system is no longer
                        indispensable;
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>no equipment is dropped, unlike dropping by parachute, which allows a certain operational
                        discretion to be obtained; and
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>as the dropping part of the container is located outside the transport plane, the
                        risks of collision with the latter are strongly reduced, and a well more extended
                        dropping field is obtained.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0027">In the dropping position, the load is dropped preferably with a simple release. However,
            within the framework of the present method, system and device, dropping can also be
            performed (in such dropping position) either by ejection or by ejection and release.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0028">Advantageously, said sliding means comprise rails fastened on the container and provided
            with an ejection device being able to slide on said rails and to support the load
            upon carrying and to release it (by simple release and/or ejection) upon dropping.
            Thus, an ejection device can be used, which is similar to a usual ejection device
            employed upon carrying and dropping for a piece of ammunition on a fighter. This enables
            to use the carrying points usually existing on ammunition and thus limits the modifications
            to be brought to the latter.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0029">Moreover, advantageously, said container comprises a cage provided with compartments
            able to receive a plurality of loads, being identical or different, which enables
            to have an operational flexibility available. Such compartments can be arranged in
            rows and/or columns. Moreover, each compartment can contain longitudinally several
            missiles if the respective sizes allow it.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0030">Since said container comprises a (single) cage provided with every means necessary
            for carrying and dropping, it is sufficient to arrange such a container in the plane
            so as to be able to implement the present method, system and device. Consequently,
            the present method, system and device do not need an important modification of the
            transport plane being used and it can be provided on any type of transport plane.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0031">Furthermore, if container connecting means are provided on the fuselage of the transport
            plane, which can be easily dismantled, the plane can be brought back to its initial
            configuration quickly and at low cost so that it can fill other types of missions,
            such as troop and/or vehicle transportation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0032">Moreover, advantageously:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>the rails are fastened on the internal sides of the container so as not to disturb
                        dropping of loads from a upper stage when the container comprises several superposed
                        stages;
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>the system according to the present disclosure comprises, for each load, dedicated
                        sliding means. So, providing sliding means adapted for the type of load being used,
                        it is possible to carry and drop different types of load with the help of only one
                        container, enabling specifically to increase the operational capacities.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
               </li>

         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0035">Furthermore, advantageously, said system also comprises a dropping control device
            being able to control the means for moving said container, as well as said sliding
            means, and which is arranged in a dedicated area of the transport plane which could
            be pressurized.
