         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates to the field of adjustable platforms and more specifically
            to the field of height adjustable platforms adapted for use in a military vehicle.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Background of the Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In many instances, occupants of vehicles need to stand up in the vehicle. For instance,
            in military vehicles, occupants of the military vehicles may need to stand in the
            vehicle with the upper portion of the occupants' bodies exposed outside of the vehicle.
            Such instances include the need to operate weaponry, improve vision outside of the
            military vehicle, and the like. Problems occur in such situations with the varying
            heights of the individuals.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Occupants of the vehicles have developed solutions such as standing on items to overcome
            problems with the varying heights. However, drawbacks to such solutions include the
            lack of stability during combat operations or rough terrain. Further drawbacks include
            problems with adjustments for the various heights of the vehicle occupants. In military
            vehicles, problems also include injuries to the standing occupant when the vehicle
            sustains the force of a mine or improvised explosive device. In such instances, a
            portion of the force is absorbed by the standing occupant's body causing severe injury
            or death.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Consequently, there is a need for a stable platform for a vehicle occupant. Further
            needs include a platform that is adjustable for varying occupant heights. Additional
            needs include improved protection for the occupant against explosive forces.
         </p>

            <b>5</b> illustrated in figref[FIGS. 1-13]
            	, ratchet platform 
            <b>5</b> is placed in a vehicle (not illustrated). Ratchet platform 
            <b>5</b> is secured in a desirable location within the vehicle. Ratchet platform 
            <b>5</b> may be secured by any suitable method such as by screwing ratchet platform 
            <b>5</b> to a floor or other surface of the vehicle. The vehicle may include any vehicle such
            as a truck, car, military vehicle, helicopter, air plane, and the like. In an embodiment,
            ratchet platform 
            <b>5</b> is placed in a military vehicle in which it is desired for an individual to stand
            on platform 
            <b>70</b>. For instance, in some military vehicles, it is desired for an individual to operate
            weaponry (i.e., machine gun) that is located on the outside of the vehicle. In such
            an embodiment, a portion of the individual's body is disposed outside of the vehicle
            during operation of the weaponry with the remainder of the individual's body within
            the military vehicle for protection. The height of platform 
            <b>70</b> is adjusted by pressing pedal 
            <b>175</b>. Each time pedal 
            <b>175</b> is pressed, the pressure from pedal 
            <b>175</b> actuates pedal linkage 
            <b>185</b> and pedal linkage 
            <b>185</b> moves upwards, which thereby actuates upper linkage 
            <b>130</b> longitudinally upward. The longitudinal movement of upper linkage 
            <b>130</b> slides ratchet pin 
            <b>135</b> longitudinally upward through the length of actuator groove 
            <b>170</b>. The upward movement of ratchet pin 
            <b>135</b> applies force to a tooth 
            <b>350</b> of ratchet rail 
            <b>100</b> thereby actuating platform upper assembly 
            <b>10</b>, which moves upward. Pressure is released from pedal 
            <b>175</b>, and torsion spring 
            <b>150</b> applies force to pedal linkage 
            <b>185</b> to actuate pedal linkage 
            <b>185</b> and move pedal linkage 
            <b>185</b> downward, which actuates upper linkage 
            <b>130</b> to move longitudinally downward. Such downward movement of upper linkage 
            <b>130</b> slides ratchet pin 
            <b>135</b> downward through the length of actuator groove 
            <b>170</b> to allow the tooth 
            <b>350</b> below the previous tooth 
            <b>350</b> (in which the force was applied) to be disposed upon ratchet pin 
            <b>135</b>. By such disposition of the next tooth 
            <b>350</b> upon ratchet pin 
            <b>135</b>, further downward movement of platform upper assembly 
            <b>10</b> is prevented. Pedal 
            <b>175</b> may be pressed and released until platform 
            <b>70</b> is at the desired height. To reduce the height of platform 
            <b>70</b>, pedal 
            <b>175</b> is pressed and held, which maintains ratchet pin 
            <b>135</b> in an upper position within actuator groove 
            <b>170</b>. With ratchet pin 
            <b>135</b> maintained in an upper position within actuator groove 
            <b>170</b>, ratchet pin 
            <b>135</b> is not in contact with teeth 
            <b>350</b>, and platform upper assembly 
            <b>10</b> slides downward until the pressure is released from pedal 
            <b>175</b> or support column 
            <b>40</b> contacts platform 
            <b>70</b>. As platform upper assembly 
            <b>10</b> slides downward, platform riser tube 
            <b>95</b> slides downward in interior 
            <b>330</b>.
