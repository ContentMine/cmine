         <h1>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a clamp. Specifically, the present invention relates
            to a clamp for attaching a pipe harness in which electric wires are inserted into
            a metal pipe to a vehicle body, in which an outer diameter tolerance of the metal
            pipe is absorbed and vibrations of the metal pipe and occurrence of abnormal noises
            are prevented.

         <h1>BACKGROUND ART</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">In hybrid cars and electric cars, there are cases where electric wires connecting
            a battery and an inverter, or an inverter and a motor are inserted into a metal pipe
            to be wired. In JP 2006-312409A (Patent Document 1), pipe harness 
            <b>100</b> is obtained by inserting electric wires 
            <b>101</b> for connecting a battery and an inverter into a metal pipe 
            <b>102</b>, and the pipe harness 
            <b>100</b> is attached to a vehicle body 
            <b>104</b> (undersurface of a floor panel) through a bracket 
            <b>103</b> shown in figref[FIG. 5]
            	. The bracket 
            <b>103</b> has an arm portion 
            <b>103</b>
            <i>b </i>protruding from a cylindrical portion 
            <b>103</b>
            <i>a </i>for being externally fitted to the metal pipe 
            <b>102</b>, and a plate-like attaching portion 
            <b>103</b>
            <i>c </i>protruding laterally from the upper end of the arm portion 
            <b>103</b>
            <i>b</i>, and the attaching portion 
            <b>103</b>
            <i>c </i>is fixed to the vehicle body 
            <b>104</b> by bolting or welding.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Moreover, JP 2008-141822A (Patent Document 2) proposes a clamp (holder) for attaching
            a pipe to a vehicle body. In a clamp 
            <b>106</b> made of a resin molded article, as shown in figref[FIGS. 6(A) and 6(B)]
            	, clamp portion

            <b>107</b>
            <i>a </i>for containing a pipe 
            <b>105</b>, and a lid portion 
            <b>108</b> for closing an opening of the receiving recessed portion 
            <b>107</b>
            <i>a </i>are coupled with a hinge 
            <b>109</b>. A fixing portion 
            <b>107</b>
            <i>d </i>for being attached to the vehicle body (not shown) projects from the clamp portion
            
            <b>107</b>. The clamp has a structure in which, when the lid portion 
            <b>108</b> is closed by inserting a locking claw 
            <b>108</b>
            <i>b </i>provided on the lid portion 
            <b>108</b> into a locking hole 
            <b>107</b>
            <i>b </i>provided on the clamp portion 
            <b>107</b> and locking it thereto, a lever piece 
            <b>108</b>
            <i>c </i>provided on the lid portion 
            <b>108</b> abuts against a lever piece receiving portion 
            <b>107</b>
            <i>c </i>provided on the clamp portion 
            <b>107</b> and the inner diameter of the receiving recessed portion 
            <b>107</b>
            <i>a </i>is reduced. With this structure, the pipe 
            <b>105</b> contained in the receiving recessed portion 
            <b>107</b>
            <i>a </i>of the clamp portion 
            <b>107</b> is firmly held to prevent positional displacement of the pipe

         <h1>Technical Problem</h1>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inner diameter of the cylindrical portion 
            <b>103</b>
            <i>a </i>of the bracket 
            <b>103</b> described in Patent Document 1 is set to a predetermined value adjusted to the size
            of the outer diameter of the metal pipe 
            <b>102</b> for being inserted thereinto. Moreover, also in the clamp 
            <b>106</b> described in Patent Document 2, when the lid portion 
            <b>108</b> is closed, the inner diameter of the receiving recessed portion 
            <b>107</b>
            <i>a </i>is set to a predetermined value adjusted to the size of the outer diameter of the
            pipe 
            <b>105</b> for being inserted thereinto. Meanwhile, variations are exhibited in the outer diameters
            of the pipes 
            <b>102</b> and 
            <b>105</b> for being inserted into the bracket

            <b>106</b> in the range of a predetermined tolerance even if they have the same size of the
            outer diameters. Some types of the pipes have a large outer diameter tolerance. The
            bracket 
            <b>103</b> and the clamp 
            <b>106</b> do not have the structures capable of absorbing the outer diameter tolerance, and
            therefore, if the pipe 
            <b>102</b> and 
            <b>105</b> having the outer diameters close to allowable lower limit values are inserted into
            the bracket 
            <b>103</b> and the clamp 
            <b>106</b> having the above-described configurations, there are cases where gaps are formed
            between the inner circumferential surfaces of the bracket 
            <b>103</b> and the clamp 
            <b>106</b> into which the pipe 
            <b>102</b> and 
            <b>105</b> are inserted, and the outer circumferential surfaces of the pipe 
            <b>102</b> and 
            <b>105</b>, so that the pipe 
            <b>102</b> and 
            <b>105</b> vibrate and abnormal noises occur.

         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to absorb an outer diameter tolerance of
