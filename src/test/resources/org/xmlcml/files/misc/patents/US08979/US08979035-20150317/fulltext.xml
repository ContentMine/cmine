<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/262,381 filed on Nov. 18, 2009, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a zero-shock separation system for a launch vehicle or spacecraft for releasably connecting a first body with a second body, especially for connecting a payload fairing to the body of a launch vehicle or spacecraft.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is a common requirement for spacecrafts that two bodies, also called stages have to be releasably connected to each other. Due to the extreme conditions during takeoff and flight, these connections have to be extremely stable but at the same time a quick and reliable separation of the two bodies has to be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In known separation systems, the first body, e.g. the payload fairing is connected to the second body, e.g. the body of the launch vehicle or spacecraft by the use of a pre-tensioned belt which is released/cut/disengaged when release of the first body from the second body is needed. This release is usually initiated once the launch vehicle or payload has reached a predetermined altitude/orbit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when such a pre-tensioned belt is suddenly released/cut/disengaged, a strong, undesirable shock arises which is transmitted to the launch vehicle or payload. Such a shock can be dangerous since it might affect the integrity or the trajectory of the launch vehicle or payload.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, due to the size of the two bodies that needs to be releasably connected, the pre-tensioning of the belt, as it is conventionally done, might prove to be a difficult task. Additionally, said tension in the belt might even cause an undesirable deformation of one of the two bodies.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem to be Solved</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The objective of the present invention is thus to eliminate these disadvantages and to provide a system for a launch vehicle or spacecraft for releasably connecting a first body with a second body wherein the separation of the two bodies can be initiated without causing a shock. A further objective of the present invention is to eliminate the difficult step of pre-tension the belt during connection of the two bodies. An even further objective of the present invention is to ensure that neither of the two bodies connected suffers a deformation due to the connection.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic perspective diagram, depicting a first embodiment the system of the present invention. A first body <b>100</b>, here a circumferential quarter segment of a cylinder, with a first interface <b>101</b> is connected with a second interface <b>201</b> of a second body <b>200</b>, here a cylindrical body. In this embodiment of the invention, the first body and the second body are coaxially arranged one around the other. The second interface <b>201</b> of the second body <b>200</b> is further provided with a circumferential trench <b>203</b> for axially receiving, preferably along a common longitudinal axis A<b>0</b> of the first body <b>100</b> and the second body <b>200</b>, at least a circumferential portion of the belt <b>300</b>. When said circumferential portion of the belt <b>300</b> is received in the circumferential trench <b>203</b>, a radial fixation of the belt <b>300</b> with relation to the second body <b>200</b> is achieved. As seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the belt <b>300</b> surrounds, at least partially, the first body <b>100</b> and thus when it is radially fixed with respect to the second body <b>200</b> it provides a corresponding radial fixation of the first body <b>100</b> with respect to the second body <b>200</b> too.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a cross-section of the first embodiment the system of the present invention along line A-A&#x2032; on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The arrangement of the first body <b>100</b> around a circumferential segment of the second body <b>200</b> is clearly shown here. The belt <b>300</b>, fixed within the circumferential trench <b>203</b>, surrounds at least partially the first body <b>100</b> and is fixed thereto by mechanical fixation means <b>301</b>. These mechanical fixation means <b>301</b> attach a circumferential portion of the belt <b>300</b> to a circumference of the first body <b>100</b>.</p>

When said circumferential portion of the belt <b>300</b> is received in the circumferential trench <b>203</b>, an axial fixation of the belt <b>300</b> with relation to the second body <b>200</b> is achieved. As seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the belt <b>300</b> surrounds, at least partially, the first body <b>100</b> and thus when it is axially fixed with respect to the second body <b>200</b> it provides a corresponding axial fixation of the first body <b>100</b> with respect to the second body <b>200</b> too.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> depicts a cross-section of the embodiment the system of the present invention along line J-J&#x2032; on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The arrangement of the first body <b>100</b> on top of the second body <b>200</b> can be seen here. The belt <b>300</b>, fixed within the circumferential trench <b>203</b>, surrounds at least partially the first body <b>100</b> and is fixed thereto by mechanical fixation means <b>301</b>. These mechanical fixation means <b>301</b> attach a circumferential portion of the belt <b>300</b> to a circumference of the first body <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A to 16C</figref> depict a sequence of schematic cross sections of the embodiment of the system of the present invention along line K-K&#x2032; on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows the system of the present invention when the first body <b>100</b> is connected to the second body <b>200</b> by means of the belt <b>300</b> being axially fixed in the circumferential trench <b>203</b>. By a corresponding profile of the circumferential trench <b>203</b>, an axial dislocation of the belt <b>300</b> from the circumferential trench <b>203</b> is prevented. Thus, the first body <b>100</b> is axially fixed with respect to the second body <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> shows the system of the present invention when the separation of the first body <b>100</b> from the second body <b>200</b> has been initiated by inducing a radial movement of said circumferential portion of said belt <b>300</b> with respect to said circumference of said first body <b>100</b> in order to radially remove said circumferential portion of said belt <b>300</b> from said circumferential trench <b>203</b>. Thus, as seen on this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>, once belt <b>300</b> is not retained anymore in the circumferential trench <b>203</b>, the first body <b>100</b> is free to axially separate from the second body <b>200</b>.</p>
