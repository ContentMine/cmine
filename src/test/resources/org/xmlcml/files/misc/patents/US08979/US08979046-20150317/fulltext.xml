<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 371 application of International Application No. PCT/KR2010/008112, filed Nov. 16, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a vacuum suction device including a hanging member in order for a towel, toilet paper or the like to be hung on the hanging member, and more particularly, to a vacuum suction device, which enhances suction force so as to be coupled to a flat surface by means of vacuum suction more solidly and for a longer time, and enhances an assembling work between each of the elements configuring the vacuum suction device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, a vacuum suction device is a member which is adhered to a surface by means of vacuum suction in order for objects of various shapes such as a towel or toilet paper rack to be hung on a flat surface such as a glass or tile surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The vacuum suction device includes a hanging member and a suction plate, the hanging member is formed for a towel or toilet paper rack to be hung on the hanging member, and the suction plate is adhered to a smooth surface or a flat surface such as a glass or tile surface by means of vacuum suction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In other words, if the vacuum suction device is, pushed to an adhered surface when the suction plate is being brought into contact with a smooth surface or a flat surface, that is, the adhered surface, air between the adhered surface and the suction plate gets out, and thus, the state of a space between the adhered surface and the suction plate is changed to a vacuum-applied state, whereupon the suction plate is sucked by the adhered surface, thereby fixing the vacuum suction device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The suction plate may be adhered to the adhered surface by directly pushing the suction plate of the vacuum suction device to the adhered surface, or the suction plate may be adhered to the adhered surface by using another member for keeping a sucking state of the vacuum suction device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, it is difficult that the vacuum suction device, which directly pushes the suction plate to the adhered surface to adhere the suction plate to the adhered surface, seals a space between the suction plate and the adhered surface, and suction force of the vacuum suction device between the suction plate and the adhered surface is weak. Therefore, the suction plate is easily separated from the adhered surface, and thus, it is difficult for the vacuum device to be fixed to the adhered surface for a long time, and the vacuum suction device separated from the adhered surface has to be repeatedly adhered to the adhered surface, and thus, it is inconvenient to use the vacuum suction device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A vacuum suction device, which adheres a suction plate to an adhered surface by using another member, according to Korean Utility Model Registration No 0420964, applied and registered by this applicant, includes a cover, a height adjustment member and a suction plate, and if the cover is rotated clockwise, a spring is wound and at the same time, a height adjustment protrusion formed inside the cover moves along a height-adjustment inclined surface, and thus, the cover is lifted by a step height, and at this point, if the height adjustment member is inserted into a height-adjustment protrusion fixing groove, the spring maintains a wound state.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, a center part of the suction plate is lifted and an outer surface of the suction plate is tightly contacting an adhered surface, and thus, a state between the adhered surface and the suction plate is changed to a vacuum-applied state, whereupon the suction plate is adhered to the adhered surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Here, the spring always starts at an initial point to make a maximum vacuum suction force when vacuum suction is performed, and the height adjustment protrusion is fixed to the height-adjustment protrusion fixing groove so as to prevent the spring from being unwound.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also, if the height adjustment protrusion is separated from the height-adjustment protrusion fixing groove by rotating the cover counterclockwise, the spring is unwound by an elastic restoring force of the spring for returning to the initial point, that is, an original position, and thus, because a vacuum-applied state between the adhered surface and the suction plate is released, the suction plate is separated from the adhered surface.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in the related art vacuum suction device, if the cover is rotated clockwise by using an elastic restoring force, the spring is wound, and at the same time, is moved to the adhered surface of the suction plate by the height adjustment member, and thus, the center part of the suction plate is lifted from the adhered surface and a vacuum-applied state is formed, whereupon the suction plate is adhered to the adhered surface. If the cover is rotated counterclockwise, the height adjustment protrusion is separated from the height-adjustment protrusion fixing groove, the vacuum-applied state is released by an elastic restoring force of the spring, the elastic restoring force making the spring restored to the initial point, and thus, the suction plate is separated from the adhered surface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Because It is very inconvenient to assemble or combine the spring, which effectuates the suction plate being adhered to the adhered surface by forming the vacuum-applied state between the adhered surface and the suction plate by using the elastic restoring force of the spring, or making the suction plate separated from the adhered surface by releasing the vacuum-applied state between the adhered surface and the suction plate, to the vacuum suction device, a work efficiency is degraded, and because the cost of the spring is relatively high, a manufacturing cost increases.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, if the spring is used for a long time, an elastic force is degraded, and thus, a performance of the vacuum suction device is degraded, and because the spring, an elastic force of which is degraded, has to be replaced after the vacuum suction device is disassembled, a replacement is very inconvenient, and a replacement cost increases.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Also, because the cover coupled to the spring has to be rotated several times in the course of the initial assembly of every element configuring the vacuum suction device so as to generate an elastic force of the spring, unnecessary work has to be added, and thus, work efficiency is degraded, and work for combining the cover and the spring is inconvenient.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, when the height adjusting protrusion formed in the cover of the vacuum suction device moves along a height-adjustment inclined surface of the height adjustment member to be inserted into the height-adjustment protrusion fixing groove, and the suction plate is adhered to the adhered surface, if the vacuum suction device is given an outer shock, the height adjustment protrusion is separated from the height-adjustment protrusion fixing groove. At the same time, a rotation of the cover of the vacuum suction device to an original position by a restoring force of the spring for returning to an original position may occur, and thus, a vacuum-applied state between the adhered surface and the suction plated is released, whereupon the suction plate is separated from the adhered surface, and thus, the vacuum suction device is so easily separated.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An operating method of the present invention described above will be provided below.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">First, when the height adjustment member <b>20</b> is being located at the top of the suction plate <b>30</b>, each of the coupling protrusions <b>34</b> of the suction plate <b>30</b> is inserted into each of the coupling hole <b>21</b><i>a </i>formed in a bottom plate <b>21</b> of the height adjustment member <b>20</b>, and thus, the height adjustment member <b>20</b> and the suction plate <b>30</b> are coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Sequentially, when the suction plate <b>30</b>, to which the height adjustment member <b>20</b> is coupled, is being located under the cover <b>10</b>, the hook <b>121</b> respectively formed in end portion of the each of the rotation protrusion <b>12</b> of the cover <b>10</b> is respectively inserted into the stop groove part <b>33</b> formed in an outer circumference, and thus, the suction plate <b>30</b> is coupled to the cover <b>10</b>, thereby a process of making the vacuum suction device <b>100</b> being completed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At this point, a bottom surface of each of the stop protrusion parts <b>13</b> of the cover <b>10</b> contacts the inclined surface <b>222</b> formed in the side plate <b>22</b> of the height adjustment member <b>20</b>, and each of the fixing pieces <b>14</b> of the cover <b>10</b> contacts the curved surface <b>233</b> of each of the elastic stoppers <b>23</b> coupled to the height adjustment member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also, one end portion of the hanging member (not shown), on which various objects such as a towel, toilet paper are hung, is inserted into the coupling groove <b>32</b> formed in the center shaft <b>31</b> of the suction plate <b>30</b>, and then, the hanging member is coupled to the center shaft <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At an initial state of the completed order of the vacuum suction device <b>100</b>, the vacuum suction device is located as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, and then, the vacuum suction device is adhered to the adhered surface (a) to be coupled to the adhered surface after the vacuum suction device <b>100</b> is located at the adhered surface (a) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A process of adhering the vacuum suction device to the adhered surface to couple the vacuum suction device to the adhered surface will be described below. If the cover <b>10</b> of the vacuum suction device <b>100</b> is rotated clockwise as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, each of the stop protrusion parts <b>13</b> moves along the inclined surface <b>222</b> formed in the top surface of the side plate <b>22</b> of the height adjustment member <b>20</b> by sliding, and because each of the stop protrusion parts <b>13</b> move only between the stoppers <b>221</b> formed in each side of the inclined surface <b>222</b>, a range of rotation of the cover <b>10</b> is limited between the stoppers <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At the same time, each of the fixing pieces <b>14</b> of the cover <b>10</b> moves by sliding along the curved surface <b>233</b> formed between the bent surface <b>231</b> and the coupling surface <b>232</b> of the elastic stopper <b>23</b>, which is coupled to the bottom plate <b>21</b> and the side plate <b>22</b> of the height adjustment member <b>20</b>, and therefore, the cover <b>10</b> is progressively separated from the adhered surface (a).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Sequentially, a lower portion of each of the stop protrusion parts <b>13</b> is inserted into the fixing groove part <b>223</b>, and if each of the fixing pieces <b>14</b> is located at the position of the bent surface <b>231</b> of the elastic stopper <b>23</b> to be hung, an outer surface of the suction plate <b>30</b> is pushed toward the adhered surface (a) by the height adjustment member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Therefore, the outer surface of the suction plate <b>30</b> tightly contacts the adhered surface (a), and at the same time, the cover <b>10</b> is separated from the adhered surface by a step height of the inclined surface <b>222</b> formed in the height adjustment member <b>20</b>, and thus, the center part of the suction plate <b>30</b> coupled to the cover <b>10</b> is lifted and the space between the center part of the suction plate <b>30</b> and the adhered surface (a) is separated at a certain interval, thereby a vacuum-applied state being formed and the vacuum-applied state being maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Therefore, a strong suction force is maintained between the adhered surface (a) and the suction plate <b>30</b>, whereupon the suction plate <b>30</b> is sucked by vacuum to the adhered surface (a), and thus, the vacuum suction device <b>100</b> is adhered to the adhered surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and therefore, various objects such as a towel or toilet paper can be hung on the hanging member coupled to the vacuum suction device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Moreover, if a separation of the vacuum suction device <b>100</b> from the adhered surface (a) is wanted, each of the stop protrusion parts <b>13</b> is separated from each of the fixing groove parts <b>223</b> of the inclined surface <b>222</b> formed in the side plate <b>22</b> of the height adjustment member <b>20</b> by rotating the cover <b>10</b> counterclockwise as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, and at the same time, each of the fixing pieces <b>14</b>, which is hung on the bent surface <b>231</b> of each of the elastic stoppers <b>23</b> to be fixed, is separated from the bent surface <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At this point, if each of the fixing pieces <b>14</b> is separated from each of the bent surfaces <b>231</b> of the elastic stopper <b>23</b>, each of the fixing pieces <b>14</b> automatically moves to a position of an initial assembling state by an elastic restoring force of the elastic stopper <b>23</b>, and thus, the cover <b>10</b> returns to an initial position, that is, an original position.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At this state, if the holding part <b>35</b> of the suction plate <b>30</b> is pulled, external air comes into a space between the suction plate <b>30</b> and the adhered surface (a), and thus, the suction plate <b>30</b> sucked by vacuum to be adhered the adhered surface (a) is separated from the suction plate <b>30</b>, thereby the vacuum suction device <b>100</b> being separated from the adhered surface (a).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described above, if the cover <b>10</b> of the vacuum suction device <b>100</b> is rotated in clockwise direction and in counterclockwise direction of the figure, the center part of the suction plate <b>30</b> coupled to the cover <b>10</b> by the stop protrusion part <b>13</b>, the inclined surface <b>222</b>, the fixing piece <b>14</b> and the elastic stopper <b>23</b> moves upward and downward with the respect to the adhered surface (a), and thus, the suction plate <b>20</b> is sucked by vacuum to be adhered to and is separated from the adhered surface (a), whereupon the vacuum suction device <b>100</b> is adhered to and is separated from a smooth surface or a flat surface such as a glass or a tile, that is, the adhered surface (a).</p>
