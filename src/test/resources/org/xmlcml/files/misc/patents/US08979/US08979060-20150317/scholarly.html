      <div>
         <h1>FIELD</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present subject matter relates generally to electronic devices, such as mobile
            phones and tablet computers, and, more particularly, to a device holder for retaining
            such devices.
         </p>

      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various device holders have been developed for retaining electronic devices, particularly
            with respect to mobile phones. Typically, the configuration of a conventional mobile
            phone holder is designed based on the size and shape of the specific mobile phone
            to be retained within the holder. Thus, numerous mobile phone holders of different
            sizes and shapes must be designed and manufactured to accommodate the various different
            types and models of mobiles phone present in the marketplace.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">To address such issue, mobile phone holders have been developed with adjustable dimensions
            that allow such holders to accommodate mobile phones of different sizes and shapes.
            However, such holders typically require one or more specific adjustment mechanisms
            that must be physically manipulated to adjust the dimensions of the holder to match
            the dimensions of the mobile phone being retained. As a result, these phone holders
            are relatively expensive to manufacture and are often difficult to use.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more
            examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way
            of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will
            be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations
            can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of
            the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment
            can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it
            is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as
            come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, the present subject matter is directed to a device holder for retaining
            electronic devices, such as mobile phones and/or tablet computers. Specifically, the
            device holder may include an outer member and an inner member configured to be received
            within the outer member. The inner member may be formed from a resilient material
            (e.g., silicone rubber) that allows the inner member to be compressed or otherwise
            deformed. Thus, in several embodiments, at least a portion of the inner member may
            be configured to be deformed relative to the outer member when an electronic device
            is inserted into the holder, with the amount of deformation of the inner member varying
            based on the dimensions of the electronic device. As such, the device holder may be
            configured to accommodate electronic devices of varying sizes and shapes.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring now to the drawings, figref[FIGS. 1-4]
            	 illustrate one embodiment of a device holder 
            <b>10</b> for retaining an electronic device 
            <b>12</b> in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. As shown, the device holder
            
            <b>10</b> may generally include an outer member 
            <b>14</b> and an inner member 
            <b>16</b>. The outer member 
            <b>14</b> may define an outer slot 
            <b>18</b> configured to at least partially receive the inner member 
            <b>16</b>. For example, as shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	, the outer member 
            <b>14</b> may include a back wall 
            <b>20</b>, a first outer sidewall 
            <b>22</b>, a second outer sidewall 
            <b>24</b> and a bottom wall 
            <b>26</b>, with the outer sidewalls 
            <b>22</b>, 
            <b>24</b> and the bottom wall 
            <b>26</b> extending from the back wall 
            <b>20</b> so as to define an open-ended, outwardly facing slot 
            <b>18</b>. Thus, when the device 
            <b>10</b> is assembled, the inner member 
            <b>16</b> may be received within the outer slot 
            <b>18</b> such that the outer member 
            <b>14</b> at least partially surrounds and/or retains the inner member 
            <b>16</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">It should be appreciated that the outer member 
            <b>14</b> may generally be formed from any suitable material. For example, in several embodiments,
            the outer member 
            <b>14</b> may be formed from a rigid or a semi-rigid material, such as a rigid or semi-rigid
            plastic material or a metal material (e.g. aluminum). It should also be appreciated
            that both the dimensions and shape of the outer slot 
            <b>18</b> may generally be selected based on the dimensions and/or shape of the inner member
            
            <b>16</b>. For example, as shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	, the outer slot 
            <b>18</b> defines a rectangular shape generally corresponding to the rectangular-shaped footprint
            of the inner member 
            <b>16</b>. However, in other embodiments, the outer slot 
            <b>18</b> may be configured to define any other suitable shape that permits at least a portion
            of the inner member 
            <b>16</b> to be received within the slot 
            <b>18</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additionally, it should be appreciated that the inner member 
            <b>16</b> may be configured to be retained within the slot 
            <b>18</b> using any suitable means. For example, in one embodiment, the inner member 
            <b>16</b> may simply be retained within the slot 
            <b>18</b> via the frictional interface created between the inner and outer members 
            <b>16</b>, 
            <b>14</b>. In another embodiment, the inner member 
            <b>16</b> may be secured within the outer slot 
            <b>18</b> using a suitable adhesive. In a further embodiment, mechanical fasteners, mating
            features and/or any other suitable attachment means may be utilized to secure the
            inner member 
            <b>16</b> within the outer slot 
            <b>18</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inner member 
            <b>16</b> of the disclosed holder 
            <b>10</b> may generally be configured to define an inner slot 
            <b>28</b> configured to at least partially receive the electronic device 
            <b>12</b> being retained within the holder 
            <b>10</b>. For example, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, the inner member 
            <b>16</b> may include a back wall 
            <b>30</b>, a first inner sidewall 
            <b>32</b>, a second inner sidewall 
            <b>34</b> and a bottom wall 
            <b>36</b>, with the inner sidewalls 
            <b>32</b>, 
            <b>34</b> and the bottom wall 
            <b>36</b> extending from the back wall 
            <b>30</b> so as to define an open-ended, outwardly facing slot 
            <b>28</b>. Thus, during use of the disclosed holder 
            <b>10</b>, the electronic device 
            <b>12</b> may be received within the inner slot 
            <b>28</b> such that the inner member

            <b>58</b> that is greater than the minimum width 
            <b>54</b>. As shown, due to the width 
            <b>58</b> of the device
