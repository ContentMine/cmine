<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to window installations for inclined roofs, in particular to a mounting bracket suitable for mounting such a roof window to a roof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Roof windows, or skylights, which are fitted to sloping or inclined roof surfaces typically compromise a main frame structure and a openable sash structure, each having top, bottom and side members, the main frame being mountable to the roof structural members and the sash being pivotally mounted to the main frame about an axis of rotation parallel with the respective top and bottom members. During installation care must be taken to ensure that the roof window is mounted to the roof at a correct height above the surrounding roof surface in order to accommodate the particular roof covering used or to be used, the various possible roof covering materials often varying widely in thickness and type.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Presently, fixtures are provided as separate items which must be attached to the window assembly by the persons installing the windows and often there can be confusion as to their correct usage in terms of setting the correct height of the window as well as overall positioning and alignment. As a result correct installation of a roof window can be a time consuming activity that is fraught with potential error and is unsuitable for unskilled workers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an object of the present invention to alleviate the disadvantages associated with the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present invention provides a mounting bracket for a roof window comprising frame mountable means, roof mountable means and hinge means for mechanically coupling the roof mountable means and the frame mountable means together so that the roof mountable means is movable between an out of use storage position and an in use mounting position, wherein the location of the pivotal point of the hinge means is movable/adjustable.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Advantageously, the roof mountable means can be moved pivotally relative to the frame mountable means and therefore pivotally relative to the frame when the mounting bracket is mounted on the window frame. This means that the mounting bracket can be stowed substantially within the boundary of the frame during transport and hinged into the mounting position for installation. However, the design of the mounting bracket to facilitate movement of the pivotal point of the hinge means also allows the roof mountable means to be adjustable relative to the frame mountable means and consequently the window frame in a plane substantially parallel to a vertical surface of the window frame in use.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Ideally, the hinge means has guide means and slide means. Advantageously, the guide means and the slide means allows the position of the pivotal point of the hinge means to be easily moved in a controlled manner. This slide means and guide means also helps to ensure the adjustability of the mounting bracket between the out of use storage position and the in use mounting position is intuitive for the person installing the roof window.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the location of the slide means is adjustable along the guide means.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Ideally, the mounting bracket has means for releasably fixing the location of the roof mountable means relative to the frame mountable means at one or more in use mounting positions. Advantageously, the releasable fixing means allows the installer to select the appropriate position for the roof mountable means to be fixed relative to the frame mounting means. A number of options are engineered into the mounting bracket based on a number of different types of roof covering materials with a different depth dimension. The off site prefixing of the position of the in use bracket mounting positions means that the installer has no measuring, awkward holding or additional screwing to do in situ on the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the guide means comprises a pair of spaced apart mutually opposing slots.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Ideally, the slide means comprises a pair of lugs for slidable engagement in the slots. Advantageously, the lugs and slots provide a simple mechanical engineering solution to allow the pivotal point of the hinge means to be adjusted along a preset track. This allows the roof mountable means to be intuitively adjusted between the out of use storage position and a range of in use mounting positions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Ideally, the spaced apart slots are formed on the roof mountable means or the frame mountable means. Advantageously, the slots are prefabricated and preferably pressed into either component of the mounting bracket during the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the pair of lugs extend from the roof mountable means or the frame mountable means. Advantageously, the lugs are prefabricated into either component of the mounting bracket during the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Ideally, the spaced apart slots are rectilinear or curvilinear. Advantageously, the curvilinear slots accommodate the roof mountable means to be stowed in an out of use position on an adjacent frame member of the roof window frame.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the guide means comprises a guide pin and the slide means comprises a collar.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Ideally, the releasable fixing means comprises male and female members provided between the roof mountable means and the frame mountable means. Advantageously, the male and female releasable fixing members pre engineered into the mounting bracket accommodate quick and safe locating of the roof mountable means in one of a range of in use mounting positions subject to the specific roofing materials to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the releasable fixing means comprises one or more tongues for interaction with one or more grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Ideally, the releasable fixing means comprises visible indicia means where the mounting bracket has two or more in use mounting positions. Advantageously, the roof window installation instructions will advise which visible indicia means corresponds to which roof covering material. Again, the technical advantage achieved is that the fitter installing the roof window does not have to measure the position each bracket should be set at for a particular roof covering material. The installer simply selects one of the prefixed positions as indicated on the installation instructions and clicks the mounting bracket into place.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the visible indicia means comprises colour coded plugs formed for insertion into grooves. Advantageously, the installer is required to make a positive decision and action to remove a colour coded plug dependent on the roof covering material being installed on the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Ideally, urging means are provided for urging the roof mountable means into either or both of the out of use storage position and the in use mounting position. Advantageously, the urging means removes the requirement for the roof mountable means to be temporarily fixed onto the frame in the storage position and also removes the requirement for temporary pinning means to hold the roof mountable means in the in use position. The urging means provides the mounting bracket with inbuilt flick fit technology giving the installer reassuring sensory feedback indicating a secure and accurate fitting of the mounting bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the urging means is provided by biasing means or magnetic means.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Ideally, the biasing means is a leaf spring acting on a portion of the roof mountable means.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, the present invention also provides a roof window with a plurality of mounting brackets as outlined above.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, the present invention also provides a mounting bracket for a roof window comprising frame mountable means, roof mountable means and means for mechanically coupling the roof mountable means and the frame mountable means together so that the roof mountable means is movable between an out of use storage position and an in use mounting position and urging means for urging the roof mountable means into either or both of the out of use storage position and the in use mounting position. The advantages of the features highlighted above apply equally to the same features recited below in relation to this aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Ideally, the mechanical coupling means is a hinge means.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Ideally, the urging means is provided by biasing means or magnetic means.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the biasing means is a leaf spring acting on a portion of the roof mountable means.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Ideally, the location of the pivotal point of the hinge means is movable/adjustable.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the hinge means has guide means and slide means.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Ideally, the location of the slide means is adjustable along the guide means.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Preferably, the mounting bracket has means for releas ably fixing the location of the roof mountable means relative to the frame mountable means at one or more in use mounting positions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Ideally, the guide means comprises a pair of spaced apart mutually opposing slots and the slide means comprises a pair of lugs for slidable engagement in the slots.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the spaced apart slots are formed on the roof mountable means or the frame mountable means.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Ideally, the pair of lugs extend from the roof mountable means or the frame mountable means.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, the spaced apart slots are rectilinear or curvilinear.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Ideally, the guide means comprises a guide pin and the slide means comprises a collar.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, the releasable fixing means comprises male and female members provided between the roof mountable means and the frame mountable means.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Ideally, the releasable fixing means comprises one or more tongues for interaction with one or more grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, the releasable fixing means comprises visible indicia means where the mounting bracket has two or more in use mounting positions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Ideally, the visible indicia means comprise colour coded plugs formed for insertion into grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A roof window with a plurality of mounting brackets as outlined above in relation to this aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Conveniently, the roof mountable means is further adapted for attachment to a roof member such as a rafter or a lathe extending between adjacent rafters.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Advantageously, the roof mountable means is removably attachable to the frame mountable means.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Alternatively, the roof mountable means can be attached to the frame mountable means by hooks, catches, claps, screws, bolts or other suitable means.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Ideally, the frame mountable means is at least one mounting plate.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably, the at least one mounting plate has at least one protruding tongue.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Alternatively, the frame mountable means is in the form of any one or more of, or combination of, the following: rail(s); recess(es); insert(s); pre-located or pre-drilled hole(s); pre-located screw(s); pre-located bolt(s); pre-located dowel(s); pre-machined locating slot(s). It should be appreciated that this is not exhaustive and that other suitable means can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Conveniently, the at least one mounting plate is provided with one or more locating tabs.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Ideally, the one or more locating tabs project perpendicularly from one edge of the mounting plate to ensure accurate alignment of said mounting plate along the edge of a window frame member against which the tab or tabs engage.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferably, the roof mountable means comprises a substantially L-shaped bracket member having a first leg and a second leg.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Ideally, the first leg is coupled to the hinge means.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Preferably, the first leg has one or more grooves mountable onto the one or more tongues of the mounting plate.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Ideally, the second leg has means for coupling the L-shaped bracket member to the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a first embodiment, the first leg is adapted to reside substantially within a space defined by a cut-out portion on the mounting plate when the second leg is attached to the roof structure.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, on opposing side edges of the first leg there are provided opposing first and second pairs of lugs which extend laterally outwardly from said leg.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Conveniently, the first pair of lugs are adapted for slidable and pivotal cooperation with guide members provided on the mounting plate so that the L-shaped bracket can be moved laterally relative said mounting plate and can be pivoted relative said mounting plate.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Conveniently, the guide members provided on the mounting plate also provide the hinge means by which the L-shaped bracket is attached to the mounting plate.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Advantageously, the second pair of lugs function as stops which dwell within pairs of spaced part complementary recesses provided on the mounting plate when a desired mounting position is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Advantageously, the complementary recesses provided on the mounting plate define predetermined first and second detent positions for the L-shaped bracket to observe, each detent position dependent upon the thickness of the type of roof covering the be used e.g. slate or tile, and which in turn determines the height of the window frame with respect to the surrounding roof surface.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Optionally, the mounting plate may be provided with additional complementary recesses so that additional predetermined detent positions for the L-shaped bracket to observe are provided thereby enabling a greater degree of mounting bracket adjustability.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Conveniently, the mounting plate is further provided with an elongate tab which extends at least partially over the cut-out portion of said mounting plate and which contacts the upper surface of the first leg in an overlapping manner when the mounting bracket is in an in-use position.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Advantageously, the tab provides additional rigidity to the mounting bracket and prevents the L-shaped bracket from rotatably moving or flexing relative the mounting plate when the mounting bracket is fastened to a window frame member and a roof member.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Advantageously, the L-shaped bracket can be pivoted backwardly over the mounting plate so that a roof window assembly incorporating the mounting brackets of the invention can be pre-packaged and delivered on-site with said mounting brackets already mounted in position and the L-shaped brackets conveniently stowed away without protruding outwardly from the window assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a second embodiment of the invention, the mounting plate is mountable over a groove or channel provided on the window frame member, the channel being provided with an urging means such as a spring which is insertable therein and which is engageable with the first leg of the L-shaped bracket when the mounting bracket is mounted to the window frame member. It will of course be appreciated that the groove or channel is one way of providing sufficient space for the urging means to function and is not an essential feature for the mounting bracket with an urging means to function properly.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the second embodiment of the invention, the spring means is a leaf spring.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Advantageously, the spring bias of the leaf spring acting upon the L-shaped bracket enables said bracket to be movable between, and maintainable at any oone of or any combination of, a stowed position, an intermediate equilibrium position and an in use mounting position.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the second embodiment of the invention, the mounting plate is provided with a tongue which is engageable with one of a plurality of complementary grooves provided in the first leg of the L-shaped bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Advantageously, the tongue acts as a stop when the bracket is moved into an in use mounting position by dwelling within one of the complementary grooves/recesses provided on the first leg of the L-shaped bracket when a desired mounting bracket position is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Advantageously, the complementary recesses provided on the L-shaped bracket define predetermined first and second detent positions for the bracket to observe, each detent position dependent upon the thickness of type of roof covering to be used e.g. slate of tile, and which in turn determines the height of the window frame with respect to the surrounding roof surface.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Conveniently, in the second embodiment of the invention the bracket is supplied with colour-coded plugs, the plugs being insertable within the respective complementary grooves/recesses and each representing a selectable window height setting in accordance with printed instructions provided with the mounting bracket or on the window frame.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The invention will hereinafter be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings which show, by way of example only, four embodiments of a mounting bracket in accordance with the invention.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a first embodiment of a mounting bracket indicated generally by the reference numeral <b>1</b> for mounting a roof window to a roof, the mounting bracket <b>1</b> having a mounting plate <b>2</b> and a L-shaped bracket <b>3</b>, the L-shaped bracket <b>3</b> being adapted for hinged attachment to the mounting plate <b>2</b>. The mounting plate <b>2</b> is adapted for attachment to a window frame member <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and the L-shaped bracket <b>3</b> is further adapted for attachment to a roof member such as an rafter of a lathe <b>60</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) extending between adjacent rafters. Two apertures <b>27</b> enable mounting plate <b>3</b> to be secured to a window frame member <b>50</b> with screws or other suitable fasteners. Two locating tabs <b>26</b> project perpendicularly from one edge of the mounting plate <b>2</b> to ensure accurate alignment along the edge of the window frame member <b>50</b> against which said locating tabs <b>26</b> engage as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The L-shaped bracket <b>3</b> has a first leg <b>31</b> and a second leg <b>32</b>, the first leg <b>31</b> being adapted to reside substantially within the space defined by a cut-out portion <b>21</b> on mounting plate <b>2</b> when the second leg <b>32</b> is attached to the roof structure <b>60</b>. The second leg <b>32</b> has apertures <b>36</b> defined therein for receiving screws or other suitable fasteners which extend through apertures <b>36</b> as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to fix the mounting bracket <b>1</b> to the lathe <b>60</b>. On opposing side edges <b>33</b> of first leg <b>31</b>, there are provided opposing pairs of lugs <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> which extend laterally from said leg. A first pair of lugs <b>34</b> are adapted for slidable and pivotal cooperation with guide members <b>22</b> provided on mounting plate <b>2</b> so that the L-shaped bracket <b>3</b> can be moved in a plane substantially parallel to the main plane of the mounting plate <b>2</b>. The lugs <b>35</b> function as stops which dwell within spaced apart pairs of complementary recesses <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> provided on the mounting plate <b>2</b> when a desired bracket mounting position is selected. Recesses <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> define predetermined first and second detent positions for the L-shaped bracket <b>3</b> to observe, each position dependent upon the type of roof covering to be used e.g. slate or tile or upon on the thickness of particular roof covering material, which in turn determines the height of the window frame within the roof and with respect to said surrounding roof covering. When L-shaped bracket <b>3</b> is moved into a first detent position with lugs <b>35</b> in engagement with recesses <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the roof window upon which mounting brackets <b>1</b> are attached will sit slightly lower relative to the surrounding roof structure than would be the case when lugs <b>35</b> are placed into the second detent position in recesses <b>23</b>. In this way the mounting bracket <b>1</b> is afforded with ready adjustability which removes installer discretion and thereby mitigates against incorrect installation.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Mounting plate <b>2</b> is further provided with an elongate tab <b>28</b> which extends at least partially over cut-out portion <b>21</b> and which contacts the upper surface of leg <b>31</b> in an overlapping manner when mounting bracket <b>1</b> is in an in-use position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>. Tab <b>28</b> provides additional rigidity to mounting bracket <b>1</b> and prevents L-shaped bracket <b>3</b> from rotatably moving or flexing relative to the mounting plate <b>2</b> when the mounting bracket <b>1</b> is fastened to a window frame member and a roof member.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>g </i>there is shown a second embodiment of mounting bracket indicated generally by the reference numeral <b>41</b> for mounting a roof window to a roof. In the second embodiment of the invention, the mounting plate <b>2</b><i>a </i>is mountable over a groove or channel <b>52</b> provided on the window frame member <b>50</b>. The channel <b>52</b> is provided with a spring <b>53</b> in the form of a leaf spring which is inserted in the channel <b>52</b> and which is engaged with the underside of the first leg <b>31</b> of the L-shaped bracket <b>3</b><i>a </i>when the mounting bracket <b>41</b> is mounted to the window frame member as shown in the Figures. Leaf spring <b>53</b> is biased so that the spring force acts against L-shaped bracket <b>3</b><i>a </i>while said L-shaped bracket <b>3</b><i>a </i>is pivoted backwardly over mounting plate <b>3</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>so that it can be maintained in a stowed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>b </i>and <b>5</b><i>e</i>), an intermediate equilibrium position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>f</i>) and an in use position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>d </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>g</i>). This enables an installer to simply flick the bracket <b>3</b><i>a </i>from the stowed position to the in use position without the requirement of having to remove any separate pinning means which would usually have been used to maintain the L-shaped bracket <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the stowed position. The spring also obviates the requirement for additional fastening members to maintain the bracket in the in use position as it is being moved into position by the installer.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the second embodiment of the invention and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>d</i>, mounting plate <b>2</b><i>a </i>is provided with a spur <b>70</b> which is engageable with one of two complementary recesses <b>72</b>, <b>73</b> provided in the first leg <b>32</b> of the L-shaped bracket <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Spur <b>70</b> acts as a stop when the L-shaped bracket <b>3</b><i>a </i>is moved into an in use position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>d</i>) by dwelling within one of the complementary recesses <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> provided on the mounting plate <b>2</b><i>a </i>when a desired bracket mounting position is selected. Each complementary recess <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> provided on the L-shaped bracket <b>3</b><i>a </i>defines alternative first and second detent positions for the L-shaped bracket <b>3</b><i>a </i>to observe in use, each detent position determining a desired height of the window frame with respect to the surrounding roof surface. The desired height is dependent upon the thickness of the type of roof covering to be used e.g. slate or tile.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the second embodiment of the invention bracket <b>3</b><i>a </i>is supplied with two colour-coded plugs <b>73</b>, <b>74</b> each plug being inserted into complementary recesses <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, respectively, and each representing a selectable window height setting in accordance with printed instructions provided with the mounting bracket <b>41</b> or on the window frame. For example, when the window is to be used on a roof which will incorporate thin tiles the window should therefore be placed at a lower height within the roof. In this case, in accordance with the instructions, it will be clear to a user that plug <b>74</b> having a particular colour should be removed to make recess <b>72</b> available to spur <b>70</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>d</i>. Conversely, where the window is to be mounted to a roof which will incorporate thick tiles, it will be clear to a user that plug <b>73</b> which has a different colour should be removed to make recess <b>71</b> available to spur <b>70</b>. The chamfered walls of recesses <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> and the wedged-shaped nature of plugs <b>73</b>, <b>74</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>are such that said plugs fit tightly within said recesses <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> cannot be pushed out by spur <b>70</b> which ensures that the bracket can only be set to a desired in use position by a user who has followed the installation instructions as described above. The same guide members <b>22</b> and lugs <b>34</b> are used as in the first embodiment to provide the hinge arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Beneficially, the use of the of the various embodiments as described above enables reliable fitment of a window to a roof structure with excellent accuracy and reproducibility. In this way, a roof window to which the mounting brackets <b>1</b>, <b>41</b> are attached can be readily accommodated in a roof irrespective of the type of roof covering used or to be used and without the need for excessive skill or judgement on the part of the person or persons installing said window.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to the drawings and now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>, there is shown a third embodiment of mounting bracket indicated generally by the reference numeral <b>91</b>. The mounting bracket <b>91</b> for a roof window <b>92</b> has a frame mountable member <b>93</b>, a roof mountable member <b>94</b> and a hinge arrangement <b>95</b> for mechanically coupling the roof mountable member <b>94</b> and the frame mountable member <b>93</b> together so that the roof mountable member <b>94</b> is movable between an out of use storage position see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and an in use mounting position, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The location of the pivotal axis of the hinge assembly <b>95</b> is movable/adjustable.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Advantageously, the roof mountable member <b>94</b> can be moved pivotally relative to the frame mountable member <b>93</b> and therefore pivotally relative to the roof window frame <b>92</b> when the mounting bracket <b>91</b> is mounted on the roof window frame <b>92</b>. This means that the mounting bracket <b>91</b> can be stowed substantially within the boundary of the roof window frame <b>92</b> during transport and subsequently hinged into the mounting position for installation. However, the design of the mounting bracket <b>91</b> to facilitate movement of the pivotal axis of the hinge assembly <b>95</b> also allows the roof mountable member <b>94</b> to be adjustable relative to the frame mountable member <b>93</b> and consequently the roof window frame <b>92</b> in a plane substantially parallel to a vertical surface <b>90</b> of the roof window frame <b>92</b> in use.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The hinge assembly <b>95</b> has a guide arrangement <b>97</b> and a slide arrangement <b>98</b>. Advantageously, the guide arrangement <b>97</b> and the slide arrangement <b>98</b> ensure that the adjustability of the mounting bracket <b>91</b> between the out of use storage position and the in use mounting position is intuitive for the person installing the roof window frame <b>92</b>. The position of the slide arrangement <b>98</b> is slidably adjustable along the guide arrangement <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The mounting bracket <b>91</b> also has a male member <b>101</b> and two cooperating female members <b>102</b> for releasably fixing the location of the roof mountable member <b>94</b> relative to the frame mountable member <b>93</b> at two in use mounting positions. It will of course be appreciated that additional in use mounting positions can be added by simply adding additional female members <b>102</b>. Advantageously, the releasable fixing arrangement <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> allows the installer to select the appropriate position for the roof mountable member <b>94</b> to be fixed relative to the frame mounting member <b>93</b>. A number of predetermined positions are engineered into the mounting bracket <b>91</b> based on a number of different types of roof covering materials with a different depth dimension. The off-site prefixing of the position of the in use bracket mounting positions means that the installer has no measuring, awkward holding or additional screwing to do in situ on the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The guide arrangement <b>97</b> comprises a pair of spaced apart mutually opposing elongate slots <b>105</b> and the slide arrangement <b>98</b> comprises a pair of lugs <b>116</b> for slidable engagement in the slots <b>105</b>. Advantageously, the lugs <b>116</b> and slots <b>105</b> provide a simple mechanical engineering solution to allow the pivotal axis of the hinge assembly <b>95</b> to be adjusted along a preset track. This allows the roof mountable member <b>94</b> to be adjusted between the out of use storage position and a range of in use mounting positions. The spaced apart slots <b>105</b> are formed on the frame mountable member <b>93</b>. Advantageously, the slots <b>105</b> are prefabricated into the mounting bracket <b>91</b> during the manufacturing process. The slots <b>105</b> are pressed. The pair of lugs <b>116</b> extend from the roof mountable member <b>94</b>. Advantageously, the lugs <b>116</b> are also prefabricated into the mounting bracket <b>91</b> during the manufacturing process. The spaced apart slots <b>105</b> are curvilinear defining a 90 degree bend section along which the lugs <b>116</b> extend. The roof mountable member <b>94</b> is an L-shaped bracket and in combination with the curvilinear slots <b>105</b>, these features allow the L-shaped bracket <b>94</b> to be stowed in an out of use position on an adjacent frame member <b>107</b> to the frame member the mounting plate <b>93</b> is mounted on.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The male member <b>101</b> in the form of a punched tongue with an upturned lip is provided on the frame mountable member <b>93</b> and the female members <b>102</b> are provided on a first leg of the L-shaped bracket <b>94</b> in the form of two grooves. Advantageously, the male and female releasable fixing members <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> are engineered into the mounting bracket <b>91</b> to accommodate quick and safe location of the roof mountable member <b>94</b> in one of two in use mounting positions subject to the specific roofing materials to be used. The grooves <b>102</b> in the first leg of the L shaped bracket <b>94</b> are brought into alignment with the tongue <b>101</b> on the frame mounted plate member <b>93</b> by their relative positioning on their respective components in combination with the positioning of the guide members <b>97</b> and slide members <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The grooves <b>102</b> are formed for receiving visible indicia members where the mounting bracket <b>91</b> has two or more in use mounting positions. Advantageously, the roof window installation instructions will advise which visible indicia member corresponds to which roof covering material. Again, the technical advantage achieved is that the fitter installing the roof window does not have to measure the position each mounting bracket <b>91</b> should be set at for a particular roof covering material. The installer simply selects one of the prefixed positions as indicated on the installation instructions and clicks the mounting bracket <b>91</b> into place. The visible indicia members are colour coded plugs formed for insertion into the grooves <b>102</b>. Advantageously, the installer is required to make a positive decision and action to remove a colour coded plug dependent on the roof covering material being installed on the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">An urging member <b>114</b> is provided for urging the L-shaped bracket <b>94</b> into either or both of the out of use storage position and the in use mounting position. Advantageously, the urging member <b>114</b> removes the requirement for the L-shaped bracket <b>94</b> to be temporarily fixed onto the roof window frame <b>92</b> in the storage position and also removes the requirement for temporary pinning fixtures to hold the L-shaped bracket <b>94</b> in the in use position. The urging member <b>114</b> provides the mounting bracket <b>91</b> with inbuilt flick fit technology giving the installer reassuring sensory feedback indicating a secure and accurate fitting of the mounting bracket <b>91</b>. The urging member <b>114</b> is provided by a biasing member such as a spring or a magnet or both.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to the drawings and now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>, there is shown a fourth embodiment of mounting bracket indicated generally by the reference numeral <b>121</b>. The mounting bracket <b>121</b> for a roof window <b>122</b> has a frame mountable member <b>123</b>, a roof mountable member <b>124</b> and a hinge arrangement <b>125</b> for mechanically coupling the roof mountable member <b>124</b> and the frame mountable member <b>123</b> together so that the roof mountable member <b>124</b> is movable between an out of use storage position see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and an in use mounting position, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The location of the pivotal point of the hinge assembly <b>125</b> is slidably movable/adjustable along a guide pin <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Advantageously, the roof mountable member <b>124</b> can be moved pivotally relative to the frame mounted member <b>123</b> and therefore pivotally relative to the roof window frame <b>122</b> when the mounting bracket <b>121</b> is mounted on the roof window frame <b>122</b>. This means that the mounting bracket <b>121</b> can be stowed substantially within the boundary of the roof window frame <b>122</b> during transport and subsequently hinged into the mounting position for installation. However, the design of the mounting bracket <b>121</b> to facilitate movement of the pivotal point of the hinge assembly <b>125</b> also allows the roof mountable member <b>124</b> to be adjustable relative to the frame mountable member <b>123</b> and consequently the roof window frame <b>122</b> in a plane substantially parallel to a vertical surface of the roof window frame <b>122</b> in use.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In this embodiment, the hinge assembly <b>125</b> has the guide member <b>127</b> in the form of a guide pin and the slide member <b>126</b> comprises a collar. The frame mountable arrangement has a first plate <b>128</b> mechanically fixed to the frame <b>122</b> at an upper edge of the frame <b>122</b> with a tubular housing <b>129</b> for housing one end of the guide pin <b>127</b> and a second plate <b>128</b> mechanically fixed to the frame <b>122</b> at the lower edge of the frame <b>122</b> with a second tubular housing <b>129</b> for hosing the other end of the guide pin <b>127</b>. Each plate <b>128</b> has a protruding male member <b>131</b> with an upturned lip. The roof mountable member <b>124</b> is an L-shaped bracket having a first leg <b>135</b> with the collar <b>126</b> attached along a lateral edge of the first leg <b>135</b> to support the main plane of the first leg <b>135</b> in a plane substantially parallel to the main plane of the mounting plates <b>128</b> in a stored position and a mounting position. The L-shaped bracket has a second leg <b>139</b> substantially perpendicular to the first leg <b>135</b> pointing towards the centre of the frame <b>122</b> in a stored position and pointing away from the frame <b>122</b> in a mounting position. Two female members <b>132</b> are provided as grooves on the first leg <b>135</b> which are alignable with the male members <b>131</b> on both mounting plates <b>128</b> in the stored position see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and the two mounting positions see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
