      <p>An aircraft taxi drive system includes a motor that is configured to transfer power
         to an aircraft wheel via a drive chain, such that the motor rotates the aircraft wheel
         via the drive chain. In some examples, the drive chain is movable between first and
         second positions. In the first position, the drive chain, such as an exterior surface
         of the drive chain, is engaged with a driven sprocket that is mechanically connected
         to an aircraft wheel. In the second position, the drive chain is disengaged from the
         driven sprocket.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aircraft may perform taxiing maneuvers on the ground, e.g., travelling from a terminal
            to the runway or vice versa. In some systems, propulsion for the aircraft while taxiing
            is provided by thrust from the main engines or a tow cart.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, this disclosure relates to devices, systems, and techniques for taxiing
            an aircraft or otherwise moving the aircraft on the ground without reliance on the
            thrust of the main engines of the aircraft (e.g., engines used to provide thrust during
            flight or takeoff) to propel the aircraft. An aircraft taxi drive system that is separate
            from the main engines provides the energy that is used to move the aircraft on the
            ground. In some examples, the aircraft taxi drive system includes a motor that is
            configured to transfer power to an aircraft wheel via a drive chain, such that the
            motor rotates the aircraft wheel via the drive chain, which may result in movement
            of the aircraft on the ground. In some examples, the drive chain (e.g., an exterior
            surface of the drive chain) is configured to be disengaged from the aircraft wheel,
            e.g., during aircraft takeoff, landing, and other times taxiing of the aircraft is
            not necessary or desired, and reengaged when taxiing is desirable (e.g., after landing).
            In some examples, the motor and drive chain may be sized to fit on an existing land
            gear assembly of an aircraft, and may allow the taxi drive system to be retrofitted
            onto existing aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one example, the disclosure is directed to a system comprising a motor configured
            to generate a mechanical output, a drive sprocket configured to be driven by the motor,
            a drive chain mechanically connected to the drive sprocket, an aircraft wheel and
            a driven sprocket mechanically connected to the aircraft wheel. The drive sprocket
            is configured to transfer the mechanical output from the motor to the drive chain.
            An exterior surface of the drive chain is configured to engage with the driven sprocket
            to transfer the mechanical output of the motor to the driven sprocket and the aircraft
            wheel. Rotation of the driven sprocket is configured to rotate the aircraft wheel.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another example, the disclosure is directed to a system comprising means for providing
            a mechanical output, an aircraft wheel, means for transferring the mechanical output
            to the aircraft wheel, and means for moving the motor and the transferring means relative
            to the aircraft wheel to bring the transferring means into and out of engagement with
            the aircraft wheel.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example, the disclosure is directed to a method comprising engaging an
            exterior surface of a drive chain with a driven sprocket that is mechanically connected
            to an aircraft wheel, rotating the aircraft wheel by transferring a mechanical output
            of a motor to the driven sprocket and aircraft wheel via the drive chain, and disengaging
            the drive chain from the driven sprocket.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure describes example aircraft taxi drive systems that can be used
            to propel an aircraft on the ground, e.g., to taxi the aircraft on the ground from
            one point to another. The example aircraft taxi drive system is carried by the aircraft
            and includes a motor that is separate from the main engines (e.g., jet engines) of
            the aircraft, such that the propulsion of the aircraft during taxiing is independent
            of the main engines used during flight. The main engines provide the thrust required
            during take-off of the aircraft and during flight, whereas the motor of the taxi drive
            system is configured to provide an output that drives an drive chain, which, when
            engaged with an aircraft wheel, rotates the wheel during taxiing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some existing aircraft taxi systems, the output of the main engines propels the
            aircraft during the taxiing of the aircraft. Reversing capability may be provided
            by thrust reversers on the one or more turbine engines of the aircraft or by reversing
            the pitch of the propellers on a prop plane. The low power settings for jet engines
            required during taxi maneuvers can be inefficient, and may result in the waste of
            hundreds of gallons of fuel for each modern commercial airliner every day. Further,
            the use of the main jet engines near the terminal and other locations may be restricted.
            In such situations, a tow cart may be required to maneuver the jet aircraft on the
            ground. The use of the tow cart to move the aircraft on the ground may consume additional
            manpower and require special equipment.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">The example aircraft taxi drive systems described herein allows an aircraft to taxi
            without reliance on the aircraft main engine(s) to provide thrust or without reliance
            on an external device, such as a tow cart. Because the example taxi drive system has
            a separate motor, the aircraft may be taxied while the main engines are shutdown or
            at idle. With the main engines idled or shutdown, the taxi drive system allows the
            aircraft to maneuver under its own power, e.g., near terminal buildings at an airport.
            In some examples, multiple taxi drive systems may be fitted onto the aircraft, allowing
            directional control, e.g., through the use of differential thrust from the taxi drive
            system. In other configurations, the taxi drive system may be mounted on a steerable
            landing gear assembly.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">As discussed in further detail below, the example aircraft taxi drive systems described
            herein are configured such that they may each be relatively easy to retrofit an existing
            aircraft to include such a taxi drive system, e.g., the retrofitting may not require
            extensive modification to the aircraft. Retrofitting existing aircraft to include
            a taxi drive system separate from the main engines may include various considerations.
            For example, retrofitting taxi drive systems onto existing aircraft without extensive
            modification may be limited by the dimensions of the landing gear and the landing
            gear bays. The taxi drive systems described herein are relatively compact, which may
            increase the number of types of landing gear the taxi drive system may be retrofit
            onto.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">Compounding the design challenges faced by a taxi system is the environment the taxi
            system operates in. During takeoff and landing, the rotation rate of the aircraft
            wheels is extremely high. Thus, permanent attachment of a taxi drive system to the
            aircraft wheels may require mass intensive transmission or clutch systems in order
            to protect the taxi drive system from damage due to the torque generated by the speeds
            involved. The example taxi drive systems described herein is configured to engage
            and disengage with the aircraft wheels, e.g., by rotation or translation of the taxi
            drive system between a first position, in which the taxi drive system is engaged with
            the aircraft wheel, and a second position, in which the taxi drive system is disengaged
            from the aircraft wheel. In some examples, a taxi drive system includes a looped drive
            chain configured such that an exterior of the looped drive chain transfers torque
            to the aircraft wheels when the system is in the first position. By using the exterior
            of the drive chain loop, the drive chain loop can be relatively easily engaged or
            disengaged from the aircraft wheel (e.g., moved to the second position) without a
            complex clutch system that may be required if the interior of the loop of the drive
            chain was used as the engagement site.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0022">Extra mass taken up by such a taxi drive system that includes a transmission or clutch
            system may decrease fuel efficiency of the aircraft and, in some cases, may reduce
            the passenger or cargo capability of the aircraft due to the extra space required
            to accommodate the taxi drive system. The example taxi drive systems described herein
            is able to engage or disengage as unit, allowing the use of a pivot or a translating
            linkage or assembly, potentially simplifying the structure and saving mass.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">Also, the landing gear assembly of the aircraft may be exposed to environmental contaminants,
            such as dirt, melted rubber, and other contaminants. Consequently, some existing taxi
            drive systems that are positioned near the landing gear may be sealed from the presence
            of contaminants, potentially leading to a heavier taxi drive system. In contrast,
            the example taxi drive systems described herein may be capable of functioning robustly
            despite the presence of contaminants, such that enclosures for the taxi drive systems
            described can be, but need not be, used.

            <b>14</b> may, for example, comprise a hydraulic cylinder in some examples. In these examples,
            upon impact with the ground during landing, aircraft tires 
            <b>12</b> may drive piston 
            <b>16</b> into cylinder

         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">Motor 
            <b>28</b> is configured to provide motive force to taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> by rotating drive sprocket 
            <b>32</b>. Drive sprocket 
            <b>32</b> may be engaged with drive chain 
            <b>30</b>, which may form a loop that is configured to surround drive sprocket 
            <b>32</b>. As drive sprocket 
            <b>32</b> rotates, the loop formed by drive chain 
            <b>30</b> also moves. When taxi drive system

            <b>20</b>, is engaged with the exterior of the loop formed by drive chain 
            <b>30</b>. Driven sprocket 
            <b>42</b> is mechanically connected to hub 
            <b>20</b> such that as driven sprocket 
            <b>42</b> rotates, hub 
            <b>20</b> rotates (e.g., driven sprocket 
            <b>42</b> can be in a fixed position relative to hub 
            <b>20</b>). Thus, as the loop formed by drive chain 
            <b>30</b> moves, the motion is transferred to driven sprocket 
            <b>42</b> (figref[FIG. 2]

         <p id="p-0090" num="0089">Taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> is configured to be disengaged prior to take off and landing. In some examples, taxi
            drive controller 
            <b>56</b> (figref[FIG. 7]
            	), as directed by user input receive via user interface 
            <b>58</b> (figref[FIG. 7]
            	), may control taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> to temporarily bring drive chain

            <b>42</b> prior to landing (
            <b>82</b>). For example, taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> may be used to “spin-up” aircraft tire 
            <b>12</b> prior to touch down (
            <b>90</b>). Spinning up aircraft tire 
            <b>12</b> prior to touch down comprises causing aircraft tire 
            <b>12</b> to rotate at a relatively high speed, e.g., at or near the rate that aircraft tire
            
            <b>12</b> will rotate after impact with the runway. This may, for example, reduce the wear
            on the aircraft tires 
            <b>12</b> by reducing the amount of skid on the runway resulting from a near stationary aircraft
            tire 
            <b>12</b> being forced to suddenly rotate at speed. Taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> may be configured to rotate aircraft tire 
            <b>12</b> at a higher rate for spin-up than for because the inertia of the aircraft may not
            encumber the ability of motor 
            <b>28</b> to provide the desired output as much during spin-up compared to during taxiing.
            After obtaining the desired rotational rate during spin up, taxi drive controller
            
            <b>56</b> may cause taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> to be disengaged from driven sprocket 
            <b>42</b>, protecting drive chain 
            <b>30</b> from being inadvertently rotated by contact with driven sprocket 
            <b>42</b> during landing (
            <b>86</b>).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0091" num="0090">Upon landing, the aircraft may use thrust reversers and friction brakes to slow the
            aircraft (
            <b>92</b>). Once the aircraft has reached a desired speed threshold, e.g., approximately 25
            knots, taxi drive controller 
            <b>56</b> may control taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> to be moved to the first position, in which drive chain 
            <b>30</b> is engaged with driven sprocket 
            <b>42</b> (
            <b>82</b>). As discussed above with respect to figref[FIG. 8]
            	, motor 
            <b>28</b> may rotate drive chain 
            <b>30</b> may be rotated to a speed that is based on a rotation rate of aircraft tires 
            <b>12</b> or the current ground speed of the aircraft (
            <b>80</b>). By rotating drive chain 
            <b>30</b> prior to engaging drive chain 
            <b>30</b> with driven sprocket 
            <b>42</b>, wear and impact on taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> and driven sprocket 
            <b>42</b> during engagement may be reduced. The wear and impact on taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> from being brought into engagement with driven sprocket 
            <b>42</b> may be particularly low when drive chain

            from taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> (
            <b>84</b>). The speed at which the aircraft taxis may be controlled by the rotation rate of
            motor 
            <b>28</b>, and, in some examples, the selection of a gear ratio within the gear box or transmission
            of motor 
            <b>28</b>. The aircraft may be slowed by decreasing the rotation rate of motor 
            <b>28</b> and/or using a braking mechanism, such as a brake disc stack. Directional control
            may be provided by installing taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> on multiple landing gear and rotating aircraft tires 
            <b>12</b> at different rates on different landing gear, e.g., differential steering. In other

            <b>24</b> may be installed on steerable landing gear assembly, for example the nose wheel of
            an aircraft. The steerable landing gear may be turned in the desired direction and
            taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> will apply force in the direction the steerable landing gear is oriented, causing
            the aircraft to turn. The rotational rate of taxi drive system 
            <b>24</b> may be controlled by commands from the pilot or other crew member in the aircraft.
            These commands may be routed into the avionics of the aircraft or to taxi drive controller
            
            <b>56</b> of taxi drive system
