      <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
      <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">Skis are generally attached to aircraft landing gear by a welding an attachment bracket
            to the landing gear. Aircraft landing gear are made with heat treated, tempered alloy
            steel, and thus welding of the attachment bracket to the landing gear can compromise
            the steel due to the intense high temperatures generated by the welding process.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Attaching such brackets requires the installer to perfectly align the bracket, secure
            the bracket during the welding process and to protect the aircraft itself from the
            hazards of the welding process. The hazards of the welding process include an extremely
            high heat source, sparks, and an electrical current on an aircraft containing highly
            volatile fuel.
         </p>

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, the present invention features attachment brackets which are configured
            to be removably mounted on aircraft landing gear, e.g., by bolting the bracket to
            the landing gear. The attachment brackets may be used to secure skis, pontoons, or
            other landing equipment to the landing gear of the aircraft. In preferred implementations,
            the brackets are bolted on using existing factory drilled holes in the landing gear.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aircraft landing gear are built in alignment with the aircraft fuselage to maintain
            proper tracking, and thus by utilizing the existing factory drilled holes in the landing
            gear, the attachment bracket aligns itself with the landing gear which then aligns
            correctly with the aircraft. This method of attachment minimizes or eliminates the
            margin for error in the attachment bracket installation process and eliminates the
            hazards associated with welding.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, the attachment bracket, when not in use or not needed again, can easily
            be removed leaving no trace of installation or usage on the landing gear. This can
            be useful, for example, when the aircraft is being sold. The removability of the bracket
            is also advantageous when the landing gear is damaged, as it allows the bracket to
            be easily removed and installed on a new landing gear. For example, if during landing
            in a remote location a stump just under the snow breaks the landing gear another pilot
            can fly in new landing gear and with the use of a few hand tools the damaged plane
            can be operational again.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the invention features a device comprising a rigid member having a
            first portion configured to be removably attached to the landing gear of an aircraft,
            and a second portion configured to allow a piece of landing equipment to be removably
            mounted on the rigid member.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some implementations include one or more of the following features. The first portion
            can include at least one bracket element configured to be bolted to the landing gear.
            In some cases, the first portion includes a pair of bracket elements, disposed such
            that bolts extending through the bracket elements are generally perpendicular to each
            other. For example, one of the brackets may be configured to be bolted to a suspension
            element of the landing gear and the other bracket configured to be bolted to a brake
            plate of the landing gear.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">The rigid member is preferably configured such that the bolt(s) extend through existing,
            factory-drilled holes in the landing gear. The brackets may be, for example, generally
            U-shaped.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">The second portion may include a bracket configured to receive a second rigid member,
            which is in some cases pivotably attached to the first rigid member, e.g., by bolting
            the second rigid member to the first rigid member. In the case of skis, this attachment
            allows the ski to pivot with respect to the landing gear. Generally, the second rigid
            member is configured to be attached to the piece of landing equipment, e.g., by bolting.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention also features methods of attaching landing equipment, e.g., skis or
            pontoons, to the landing gear of an aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, the invention features a method that includes removably attaching to
            the landing gear a rigid member having a first portion configured to be removably
            attached to the landing gear and a second portion configured to allow a piece of landing
            equipment to be removably mounted on the rigid member.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">Some implementations include one or more of the following features.</p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">Removably attaching the rigid member includes bolting the rigid member to the landing
            gear, e.g., through existing, factory drilled holes in the landing gear. The rigid
            member may include any one or more of the features described above. The method may
            further include drilling a hole in the bracket that is bolted to the brake plate prior
            to bolting the bracket to the brake plate, e.g., using the brake plate as a drill
            guide to position the holes.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present disclosure relates generally to attachment brackets that are configured
            to be bolted onto the landing gear of an aircraft, using existing bolt holes in the
            landing gear, and allow landing equipment, such as skis or pontoons, to be removably
            attached to the landing gear. The attachment brackets are suitable for use with standard
            aircraft landing gear, for example Piper Cub style landing gear.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">As will be discussed in detail below, the attachment brackets include component parts
            that are welded together creating a single part. The parts are configured to facilitate
            the attachment of the bracket to the landing gear. The shapes of the parts are also
            designed to interface with each other to reinforce the other parts of the bracket
            in high stress areas. In some implementations, the parts are welded in a welding jig
            that is built with the actual design and style of landing gear that the attachment
            bracket is designed to attach to.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">figref[FIG. 1]
            	 shows a pair of attachment brackets 
            <b>10</b> in use, each bracket attaching a ski 
            <b>12</b> to the landing gear 
            <b>14</b> of an aircraft 
            <b>16</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to figref[FIG. 2]
            	, the bracket 
            <b>10</b> includes an upper rigid member 
            <b>18</b> and a lower rigid member 
            <b>20</b>, which are pivotably attached by a bolt 
            <b>22</b> that extends through a bracket 
            <b>23</b> extending from the lower surface of the rigid member 
            <b>18</b>. Bracket 
            <b>23</b> is positioned to provide proper alignment between the landing equipment (ski 
            <b>12</b>) and the landing gear. The upper and lower rigid members may be made, for example,
            of chromoly steel or other high strength material. The lower rigid member 
            <b>20</b> includes a rigid cylindrical member 
            <b>21</b> for receiving the bolt, two generally parallel, spaced, vertical triangular members
            
            <b>19</b> welded to the cylindrical member, and a mounting plate 
            <b>25</b> welded to the triangular members. The mounting plate 
            <b>25</b> is configured to be bolted to a piece of landing equipment, e.g., as ski 
            <b>12</b> as shown. The arrangement of the triangular members, mounting plate, and cylindrical
            member provides a high strength assembly designed to withstand landing forces.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to figref[FIG. 2A]
            	, the upper rigid member 
            <b>18</b> includes a first bracket 
            <b>24</b> and a second bracket 
            <b>26</b> disposed at right angles to the first bracket. This arrangement provides the upper
            rigid member with high strength and helps to enable the upper rigid member to withstand
            the forces exerted on it during landing. In the implementation shown in the figures,
            the first and second brackets are welded to a support plate 
            <b>27</b>. Bracket 
            <b>23</b> is also welded to plate 
            <b>27</b>.

         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">Bracket 
            <b>24</b> fits around the area of the landing gear where the suspension strut 
            <b>30</b> is bolted to the axle housing 
            <b>32</b>, and is held in place by a bolt 
            <b>33</b> that extends through the factory drilled holes that are used for that purpose. The
            bolt 
            <b>33</b> is slightly longer than the factory-supplied bolt, to accommodate the thickness of
            the bracket, but otherwise is similar to and functions in the same manner as the original
            bolt. This assembly is shown in further detail in figref[FIG. 3]
            	.

         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to figref[FIG. 4]
            	, the hole through which bracket 
            <b>26</b> is bolted to the brake plate may in some cases be drilled by the installer, rather
            than the supplier of attachment bracket 
            <b>10</b>. To do this, the installer would remove the wheel from the axle, insert bolt 
            <b>33</b> into the factory drilled holes in the brake plate 
            <b>34</b> and plate 
            <b>35</b> to position the bracket 
            <b>26</b> in its proper alignment, and then use the brake plate as a drill guide to ensure
            that the hole is drilled in the correct position. Having the installer drill this
            hole allows the hole to be correctly positioned regardless of the hole pattern of
            the brake plate that is present in the landing gear, and accommodates the variation
            between such hole patterns.
