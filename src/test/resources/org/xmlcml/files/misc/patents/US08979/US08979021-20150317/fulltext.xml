<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The exemplary hydraulic air bleed valve system relates to an air bleed valve that is activated based on signals from an acoustic wave sensor(s).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Air bleed valves are used in aircraft hydraulic systems to remove unwanted air from the hydraulic circuit prior to the operation of the high pressure hydraulic system to prevent unexpected and unwanted operational anomalies. Due to certain flight regimes, a traditional air bleed valve cannot be used in certain high performance aircraft, primarily those aircraft used in military applications. High G loads and inverted flight modes do not allow the air in the hydraulic system to be bled when experiencing these flight regimes. Therefore it is necessary to use sensors to determine when there is air in the hydraulic system and then electronically open an air vent valve to discharge the air when the aircraft is flying in a suitable flight mode. Traditional air bleed valves are usually bled when the pilot manually triggers the vent valve circuit. Sensors can be used in the air bleed valve such as a light emitting diode and a photoelectric diode to indicate that there is air in the hydraulic system and then send a signal to the pilot that the air vent in the air bleed valve needs to be activated. Pub. No. US 2010/0319791 A1 to Dirkin et al. disclose such a system. In the Dirkin system two LEDs and a phototransistor and three transparent windows are used to sense the presence of air. When air is detected by an electronic circuit which is connected to the phototransistor and the LEDs, a signal is sent to the flight deck so that the vent valve can be activated. This system is subject to several operational limitations involving clouding of the windows and failure of the phototransistor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Other bleed air systems known in the art include those shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,524,793 and 4,813,446 to Silverwater et al. These prior art devices provide for the automatic bleeding of air at the time of hydraulic pump start up only using differential pressure between the air and the hydraulic oil to move a piston to control the bleeding process. This system is self activating and is not controlled by the flight crew or an electronic control system so the air is automatically vented whenever it is present irrespective of the aircraft flight mode. This presents a problem in high performance aircraft since the air cannot be vented in certain flight regimes. Also, this type of air bleed valve is not as reliable or dependable as what is needed in the industry for use in high performance aircraft.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The exemplary electronically controlled air bleed valve system provides for a robust solution for bleeding air from a hydraulic system whenever the level of air in a plenum exceeds a set level that is measured with the use of one or more acoustic wave sensors. One sensor can be located to set the characteristic wave propagation transfer function when submerged in oil while a second sensor can be located at the minimum allowable level of air allowed within the hydraulic plenum. An electronic control system processes the signals generated by the acoustic wave sensors and uses these to determine if the vent valve should be opened to allow the air to be bled from the hydraulic system. The vent valve can be a solenoid valve or a MEMs type valve or other type of vent valve mechanism which can be activated quickly and with a relatively low electrical power requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of acoustic wave sensors in an aircraft air bleed valve is new and offers several advantages including low cost, reliability, ease of installation, low maintenance, accuracy and expanded functionality. In addition, this type of advanced sensor can be used as an integral part of a prognostic health management system. The acoustic wave sensor(s) can be one of several different types and configurations but the preferred version is that known in the art as a Shear Horizontal Surface Acoustic Wave (SH-SAW) device. This type of device works particularly well in the present air bleed valve system to sense the presence of air in hydraulic oil based system and can result in a more compact packaging which is easier to place within the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The exemplary air bleed valve system is particularly adaptable for use in aircraft in that the air can be accurately sensed and then vented when the aircraft is in a suitable flight regime. When connected to a flight control system, operation can be automatic instead of manual. The exemplary system is mounted at the highest point where the air in hydraulic system is collected and will bleed air effectively even during flight without manual intervention and will not allow fluid leakage from the pressurized hydraulic reservoir even when the aircraft is in a high G or inverted orientation. The use of acoustic wave sensors in the air bleed valve provides more accurate and dependable venting of the air in the hydraulic system. These acoustic wave sensors are reliable and relatively inexpensive compared to prior art sensors. The output of the acoustic wave sensors can be electrically connected to an electronic circuit such as a computer so that input and output signals can be processed and used to control when an activation signal is sent to the vent valve for discharge of the excess air in the hydraulic system. Or, the sensors can be electrically connected to a stand-alone circuit that controls the air bleed valve. This circuit can communicate with a flight computer system that signals when the aircraft is in a flight mode that is conducive to the opening of the vent valve.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to the discussion that follows and also to the drawings, illustrative approaches to the disclosed systems and methods are shown in detail. Although the drawings represent some possible approaches, the drawings are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be exaggerated, removed, or partially sectioned to better illustrate and explain the present disclosure. Further, the descriptions set forth herein are not intended to be exhaustive or otherwise limit or restrict the claims to the precise forms and configurations shown in the drawings and disclosed in the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Moreover, a number of constants may be introduced in the discussion that follows. In some cases illustrative values of the constants are provided. In other cases, no specific values are given. The values of the constants will depend on characteristics of the associated hardware and the interrelationship of such characteristics with one another as well as environmental conditions and the operational conditions associated with the disclosed system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings, a perspective view of a first embodiment of an acoustic wave sensor <b>10</b> that can sense hydraulic oil characteristics and utilizes a configuration known as a Shear Horizontal Surface Acoustic Wave (SH-SAW) device. An input transducer <b>12</b> is formed on the surface of the piezoelectric substrate <b>14</b> using a suitable thin film process and in a similar fashion; an output transducer <b>16</b> is also formed on the surface of the piezoelectric substrate <b>14</b> using a thin film process such as a photolithographic technology that is well known in the art. An electrical signal is provided to the input transducer <b>12</b> that will generate acoustic wave that propagates to the output (receiving) transducer <b>16</b> which generates an electrical signal that can be used to determine the properties of a fluid, such as hydraulic oil, that surrounds the piezoelectric substrate <b>14</b>. Any change in physical, chemical, biological or electrical properties of media in contact with the acoustic wave sensor will cause corresponding change in the oscillating frequency of the acoustic wave generated by the input transducer <b>12</b>, the acoustic wave generated by the input transducer <b>12</b> which is sensed by the output transducer <b>16</b> which generates an output electrical signal which can be connected to an electric circuit or a computer. The same principle is used to detect the presence or absence of a liquid which can be achieved when the piezoelectric substrate contacts the liquid and/or the air that is present and surrounds the acoustic wave sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the drawings, a second alternative embodiment of the acoustic wave sensor <b>10</b>A is shown. The acoustic wave sensor <b>10</b>A is formed into a disc shape by reconfiguration of the input transducer <b>12</b>A and the output transducer <b>16</b>A into a partial nested hoop shape mounted on the piezoelectric disc <b>14</b>A. This configuration is particularly adaptable to tight packaging situation where the object is to determine the properties of the media. The nested input and output transducers <b>12</b>A, <b>16</b>A provide for a compact geometry and reduce the cost of manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of the drawings, a third alternative embodiment of the acoustic wave sensor <b>10</b>B is shown in a perspective view. This sensor <b>10</b>B is comprised of an input transducer <b>12</b>B and an output transducer <b>16</b>B which are formed using thin film or micromachining technology on the surface of a membrane <b>18</b> formed on the top of a piezoelectric layer <b>20</b> which is attached to a silicon substrate <b>14</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> of the drawings, the structures and results of the testing of an acoustic wave sensor <b>130</b>A, <b>130</b>B are shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a test acoustic wave sensor <b>130</b><i>a </i>which consists of a fluid <b>200</b> covering a sensing film <b>215</b> which is formed on a first electrode <b>220</b> the assembly of which is bonded or formed using thin film techniques or otherwise attached to an AT quartz substrate <b>210</b>. On the opposite side of the substrate <b>210</b> is a second electrode <b>225</b> which is formed or bonded or otherwise attached to the substrate <b>210</b>. An o-ring <b>230</b> is used to seal a containment ring <b>235</b> to the substrate <b>210</b> and holds the test fluid <b>200</b> so that it contacts the sensing film <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a test acoustic wave sensor <b>130</b><i>b </i>which consists of a fluid <b>300</b> covering a first electrode <b>320</b> which is attached to and AT quartz substrate <b>310</b>. On the opposite side of the substrate <b>310</b> is a second electrode <b>325</b> which is formed on or bonded or otherwise attached to the substrate <b>310</b>. An o-ring <b>330</b> is used to seal a containment ring <b>335</b> to the substrate <b>310</b> and holds the test fluid <b>300</b> so that it contacts the first electrode <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The acoustic wave sensor <b>130</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> was tested and the test results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in a cross-sectional view of the acoustic wave sensor <b>130</b>A and of the shape of the actual acoustic wave as it exists in the sensor <b>130</b>A. The first electrode <b>220</b> and the second electrode <b>225</b> are connected across a voltage source <b>250</b> which supplies an alternating signal at a frequency of approximately 25 to 500 MHz to the first and second electrodes <b>220</b>, <b>225</b> to excite the acoustic wave sensor <b>130</b>A to form the acoustic wave <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Acoustic wave sensors such as <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A or <b>10</b>B are typically surface acoustic wave (SAW) type devices and act as band pass filters in both the radio frequency and intermediate frequency sections of the transceiver electronics. New applications outside of the telecommunications market include uses for air pressure sensors, chemical sensors, and sensors for commercial applications such as the sensing of vapor, humidity, and temperature. Acoustic wave sensors are cost effective, rugged, sensitive and reliable when used in an air bleed valve and especially in an air bleed valve for use in an aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Acoustic wave sensors are so named because their method of detection depends on an acoustic wave that propagates through or on the surface of a supporting layer. As the acoustic wave propagates through or on the surface of the material, any changes to the characteristics of the propagation path affect the velocity and/or amplitude of the acoustic wave. Changes in velocity of the travelling acoustic wave can be monitored by measuring the frequency or phase characteristics of the wave which can then be processed by an electronic circuit or computer to output the character of the physical quantity being measured.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The acoustic wave sensors <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B of the exemplary invention make use of a piezoelectric material to generate the acoustic wave. An oscillating electrical current at a frequency of approximately 25 to 500 MHz is supplied to the input transducer <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B which creates a mechanical stress which propagates through the substrate and is then converted back to an electric field by the output transducer <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B and then outputted to an electronic circuit or computer for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The exemplary acoustic wave sensors <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A or <b>10</b>B can be effectively fabricated by means of a photolithographic process similar to that used to make integrated circuits. Among the various piezoelectric materials that can be used for acoustic wave sensors and devices, the most popular are quartz (SiO2), lithium tantalite (LiTaO3), and lithium niobate (LiNbO3). Each has their own unique characteristics such as cost, temperature effects, attenuation and propagation velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The acoustic wave that propagates through the substrate is called a bulk wave. The most commonly used bulk acoustic wave (BAW) devices are the thickness shear mode (TSM) resonator and the shear-horizontal acoustic plate mode (SH-APM) sensor. If the wave propagates on the surface of the substrate, it is known as a surface wave. The most widely used surface wave devices are the surface acoustic wave sensor and the shear-horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) sensor as used in the present is also known as the surface transverse wave (STW) sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The acoustic wave devices can be used to sense many different physical parameters including gas but only a subset will work when in contact with liquids. The TSM, SH-APM and SH-SAW all generate waves that propagate primarily in the shear horizontal direction. The shear horizontal wave does not radiate significantly into liquids and thus, there is not significant damping of the wave by the liquid. This characteristic makes these particular acoustic wave devices suitable for use in liquids such as hydraulic oil of the exemplary air bleed system. The SH-SAW type of device is shown in the present exemplary acoustic wave sensing system (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">SAW type sensors have the highest sensitivity of the acoustic sensors described above and typically operate from 25 to 500 MHz. In the case of liquid sensing, a SH-SAW should be used in that the wave propagation mode changes from a vertical shear SAW sensor to a shear-horizontal SAW sensor which dramatically reduces loss when liquids, such as hydraulic oil, come into contact with the sensor. The damping effect of the liquid is significantly reduced with the SH-SAW sensor which makes it suitable for use when detecting the presence and characteristics of liquids such as hydraulic oil. The acoustic wave sensors <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B are shown as a SH-SAW type device. The range of phenomena that can be detected by this device can be determined by the coating used on the device. These devices can detect the characteristics of gas or liquids by coating the device with a material that undergo changes when exposed to the gas or liquid of interest. Changes in the coating cause the propagation of the wave to be changed which can be used to calculate the characteristics of the gas or liquid. The presence or absence of a liquid can thus be easily detected. If the particular acoustic wave sensor is sensitive to temperature changes, a second acoustic wave sensor can be used, either mounted in a non-stressed area of the substrate or a physically separate device can be used to compensate for changes in temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> of the drawings, a cross-sectional view of the present exemplary air bleed valve system <b>50</b> is shown. The air bleed valve system <b>50</b> consists of a housing <b>51</b> which is connected to hydraulic reservoir and sealed with an O-ring <b>52</b> to prevent any external leakage. The hydraulic fluid <b>54</b> and the air within the hydraulic fluid <b>54</b> from the hydraulic reservoir will come in passage <b>53</b> and the air will be separated from the oil to form a volume <b>55</b>. Two acoustic wave sensors <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> similar to either those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> are mounted in the housing <b>51</b>. The sensor <b>57</b> will be mounted in such a way that it will always be immersed in the hydraulic fluid <b>54</b> and acts as a temperature compensator. The sensor <b>56</b> is mounted at a predetermined height inside the housing <b>51</b> and works as a liquid sensing SH-SAW acoustic wave sensor. When it is submerged in oil, a vent valve <b>59</b> remains closed and when the sensor <b>56</b> signals that air is present in the volume <b>55</b>, then the vent valve <b>59</b> is opened to vent the air out of the volume <b>55</b>. Oil then replaces the air that is vented.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The output signals from sensors <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> are sent to an air bleed controller <b>65</b> which processes and then compares the two signals from sensors <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> respectively and uses the result to determine whether to close or open the vent valve <b>59</b>. The controller <b>65</b> can be a separate circuit or part of a larger multi-functional processing circuit or it can be connected to a flight computer system <b>67</b>. The vent valve <b>59</b> can be a solenoid valve or a piezo actuator type valve or a voice coil based actuator or any other type of open and closing valve device. The valve <b>59</b> closes or opens the passage <b>60</b> to allow the air to travel from the volume <b>55</b> into passage <b>60</b> from where the air can be bleed outside the system through bleed port <b>62</b>. The vent valve <b>59</b> can be configured to be normally closed when no activation signal is present. The air bleed controller <b>65</b> is an electronic circuit that can include a microprocessor that is programmed to process the electrical signals from the acoustic wave sensors <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>. The bleed controller <b>65</b> then can send a signal to activate the vent valve <b>59</b> if air is present in volume <b>55</b> instead of hydraulic oil. The air is then released from the volume <b>55</b> and is replaced by hydraulic fluid. At this time the sensors <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> should generate approximately equivalent output signals and the controller <b>65</b> would remove the activation signal from the vent valve <b>59</b> and it would close. Optionally, a flight computer system <b>67</b> is connected to the bleed controller <b>65</b> to signal when the aircraft is operating in a mode which is conducive to the venting of air from the hydraulic system.</p>
