            is incorporated herein by reference.
         </p>

         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a display device opening-and-closing system that
            is mounted in a movable carrier such as an aircraft and a train, and is operable to
            open and close the display device between a stowage position and a view position (use
            position).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, a display device is provided above passengers' seats and/or on the
            back surface of a backrest of a passenger's seat in a movable carrier, particularly,
            in an aircraft so as to display, as an in-flight entertainment service, contents such
            as movies and flight information indicating, for example, an actual location.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">A display device provided on the back surface of a backrest of a passenger's seat
            is for personal use, whereas display devices provided above passengers' seats can
            be each shared and viewed by several passengers.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">figref[FIG. 5]
            	 is a schematic diagram illustrating a display device which is provided above passengers'
            seats in an aircraft. In figref[FIG. 5]
            	, a display device 
            <b>420</b>, which is designed so as to be provided above passengers' seats 
            <b>410</b>, is stowed in a stowage position 
            <b>421</b> in a cabin top inner surface portion 
            <b>440</b> when the display device 
            <b>420</b> is not used, so as to ensure a space above the passengers' seats 
            <b>410</b> and safety for passengers 
            <b>430</b>. When the display device 
            <b>420</b> is used, the display device is opened, and held in a view position 
            <b>422</b> to display a video image.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">For this type of display device, a liquid crystal display is used in many cases. In
            consideration of the characteristics of a view angle for the liquid crystal display,
            the display needs to be opened such that the view position is 90 degrees or more away
            from the stowage position. Therefore, in order to hold the display device in the view
            position, a drive shaft needs to have mounted thereto a retaining mechanism, such
            as a clutch or a brake, for holding the display device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, this type of display device needs to normally operate, with certainty,
            under a certain amount of shaking, while the display device needs to be closed into
            the stowage position for safety when at least a predetermined amount of force is applied
            to the display device from behind the display device, for example, when a person or
            any other object collides against the display device, because the top of the cabin
            is lower at the view position for the display device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">An example in which a focus is placed on influence of shaking of the movable carrier
            is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2007-161041 (hereinafter,
            referred to as Patent Document 1), and an example in which safety is considered in
            the case of a collision between a person and a display device is disclosed in Japanese
            Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 5-97098 (hereinafter, referred to as Patent Document
            2).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the conventional display device opening-and-closing system for use in a movable
            carrier as disclosed in Patent Document 1, shaking of the movable carrier is detected,
            and when at least a certain amount of shaking of the movable carrier is detected,
            the holding state is changed. Thus, deviation of the display device from the view
            position can be prevented.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, only the shaking of the movable carrier itself is detected, and impact to
            the display device is not detected. Therefore, although normal operation can be maintained
            under a shaking state, it cannot be detected that at least a certain amount of force
            has been applied to the display device located at the view position, from behind the
            display device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, it is impossible to alleviate impact of a colliding person or any other
            colliding object. Further, the display device may be damaged.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, Patent Document 2 discloses that, when a predetermined amount of force is
            applied to the display device, the display device is detached from a driving mechanism
            by means of a slipping clutch so as to freely swing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, in the event of collision of a person against the display device, the slipping
            clutch is operable to retract the display device, thereby absorbing some amount of
            force.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, depending on shaking of a movable carrier, the display device is automatically
            stowed when no person collides against the display device. In order to prevent the
            display device from being stowed due to the shaking of the movable carrier, retaining
            force needs to be increased, so that the impact of a colliding person is also increased.
            Further, the display device may be damaged.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">Namely, the conventional openable and closable display device which is mounted to
            the cabin top inner surface portion of the movable carrier cannot be designed such
            that the display device is held in the view position even under a certain amount of
            shaking, while the display device is closed into the stowage position for safety when
            at least a certain amount of force is applied to the display device located at the
            view position, from behind the display device. That is, these contradictory operation
            specifications cannot go together.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a display device opening-and-closing
            system which is used for a display device designed so as to open and close between
            a stowage position and a view position, and which is capable of not only holding the
            display device in the view position even under a certain amount of shaking, but also
            causing the display device to be stowed for safety when at least a certain amount
            of force is applied to the display device located at the view position, from behind
            the display device. This type of display device opening-and-closing system can be
            realized by using a swinging support device of the present invention the application
            of which is not limited to display devices.

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">In order to solve the problems described above, a swinging support device according
            to one aspect of the present invention is provided in a movable carrier, and supports
            a subject article provided in the movable carrier to let the subject article swing
            between a use position and a stowage position. The swinging support device includes:
            a swinging mechanism for swinging the subject article; a retaining mechanism for holding
            the subject article in the use position with at least two levels of retaining force;
            an acceleration sensor for detecting acceleration of the movable carrier; and a control
            unit for controlling, according to the acceleration of the movable carrier, the retaining
            mechanism to switch between the two levels of the retaining force. Further, a swinging
            support device according to another aspect of the present invention includes: a swinging
            mechanism for swinging the subject article; a retaining mechanism for holding the
            subject article in one of the e position and the stowage position; a first acceleration
            sensor for detecting acceleration of the movable carrier; a second acceleration sensor
            for detecting acceleration of the subject article; and a control unit for controlling
            the swinging mechanism according to the acceleration of the movable carrier and the
            acceleration of the subject article.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the features described above, the shaking of the movable carrier is detected, and
            a voltage to be supplied to the retaining mechanism for holding the display device
            which is the subject article is varied by the voltage-variable circuit, so that the
            retaining force for holding the display device can be determined based on the state
            of the movable carrier. Therefore, when the movable carrier is greatly shaking, the
            retaining force is increased, and the display device is held in the view position
            with the increased retaining force, and in a normal state where the shaking of the
            movable carrier is small, the retaining force is reduced to alleviate impact of a
            colliding person. Further, when at least a certain amount of force is detected (when
            a person has collided) by detecting the shaking of the movable carrier and the shaking
            of the display device, the display device can be stowed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">As described above, the swinging support device according to the present invention
            holds the display device which is the subject article, in the view position, even
            when the shaking of the movable carrier is great. Further, the swinging support device
            according to the present invention is able to alleviate impact of a colliding person
            in a normal state, and the display device can be stowed when it is detected that at
            least a certain amount of force has been applied to the display device, from behind
            the display device.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0022">These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention
            will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention
            when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

         <p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thus, both the shaking of the movable carrier and the shaking of the display device
            can be detected. Therefore, even when the shaking of the movable carrier is great,
            the display device can be held in the view position. In a normal state in which the
            shaking of the movable carrier is small, the retaining force is reduced for safety
            in consideration of a case where, for example, a person collides against the display
            device located at the view position, from behind the display device. Further, when
            at least a certain amount of force is applied to the display device, the display device
            is closed into the stowage position. These contradictory operation specifications
            as described above can be satisfied.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, when the shaking of the movable carrier is great, a person is less likely
            to move from a seat, and will pay attention to the surroundings. Therefore, careless
            collision of the person against the display device in the opened state is less likely
            to occur, and it does not matter if the retaining force is increased.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the other hand, when the shaking of the movable carrier is small, a person is likely
            to move from a seat, and is likely to be careless. Therefore, the person is likely
            to collide against the display device in the opened state. In this case, when the
            retaining force is reduced, the impact of the collision is reduced, and the person
            is less likely to be injured. Further, the display device is less likely to be damaged.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the present embodiment, although the first acceleration sensor is mounted to the
            top inner surface portion of the movable carrier in the vicinity of the display device,
            the first acceleration sensor may be mounted to the display device in a portion in
            which the display device is mounted to the movable carrier. In this case, the shaking
            for the vicinity of the display device can be detected with enhanced accuracy, thereby
            enabling enhancement of accuracy for controlling the retaining force.

         <p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, as shown in figref[FIG. 4]
            	, the first acceleration sensor may be mounted to a display case

            <b>190</b> side). In this case, the first acceleration sensor 
            <b>160</b> may be produced so as to be integrated with the display unit 
            <b>200</b>, thereby reducing cost. When the first acceleration sensor 
            <b>160</b> is mounted to the movable carrier as shown in figref[FIG. 2]

            <b>200</b> and the first acceleration sensor 
            <b>160</b>. However, when the first acceleration sensor 
            <b>160</b> is integrated with the display unit

         <p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, in the present embodiment, the retaining force for holding the display device
            in the view position is switched between two levels of retaining force. However, the
            number of the levels of the retaining force to be switched may be increased. In this
            case, the control may be minutely performed according to the levels of the shaking
            of the movable carrier.

         <p id="p-0059" num="0058">The display device opening-and-closing system according to the present invention ensures
            the visibility for passengers when the movable carrier is shaking, and, in a normal
