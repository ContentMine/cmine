         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein generally relate to methods and
            devices and, more particularly, to mechanisms and techniques for increasing a pressure
            applied to a ram blowout preventer (BOP) for sealing a wellbore.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">One apparatus for sealing a well is the ram BOP. The ram BOP (herein simply BOP) is
            a safety mechanism that is used at a wellhead of an oil or gas well. The BOP may be
            used for offshore drilling and also for land-based drilling. The BOP is configured
            to shut the flow from the well when certain events occur. One such event may be the
            uncontrolled flow of gas, oil or other well fluids (e.g., mud) from an underground
            formation into the well. Such event is sometimes referred to as a “kick” or a “blowout”
            and may occur when formation pressure exceeds the pressure generated by the column
            of drilling fluid. This event is unforeseeable and if no measures are taken to prevent
            and/or control it, the well and/or the associated equipment may be damaged.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">The BOP may be installed on top of the well to seal the well in case that one of the
            above events is threatening the integrity of the well. The BOP is conventionally configured
            to prevent the release of pressure either in the annular space between the casing
            and the drill pipe or in the open hole (i.e., hole with no drill pipe) during drilling
            or completion operations.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this regard, the BOP has two ram blocks that are configured to move towards each
            other or away from each other as desired by the operator of the rig. The operator
            of the rig controls the closing and opening of the ram blocks by activating various
            valves that control a hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic fluid is either provided from
            accumulators provided next to the BOP (e.g., undersea for an undersea BOP) or through
            pipes from the surface. By allowing the hydraulic fluid under pressure to enter a
            closing chamber the ram blocks are closed and by allowing the hydraulic fluid to enter
            an opening chamber the ram blocks are opened.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The ram blocks have at their frontal faces an elastomeric material, a packer, that
            has a semi-spherical profile. Thus, when the drill line is still inside (i.e., crossing
            the BOP) and there is a need to close the well, the ram blocks close around the drill
            line and the profile of the packers ensure that an interface between the drill line
            and the ram blocks is sealed. It is noted that shearing ram blocks have cutting edges
            instead of packers and when there is a need to close the BOP, the shearing ram blocks
            will close the well by severing the drill line.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in practice it is noted that sometimes the interface between the packers
            and the drill line is not completely sealed, i.e., there is a leakage of mud or other
            fluids that are present in the well. The leak is more serious as the diameter of the
            drill line increases. Thus, there is a need in the industry to provide a better sealing
            when a ram block with a packer is used to close a well while a tool is still inside
            the BOP.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide systems and methods that achieve the
            sealing of the well irrespective of the diameter of the drill line and to avoid the
            above noted shortcomings.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one exemplary embodiment, there is a ram blowout preventer (BOP) for
            sealing a well. The ram blowout preventer includes a body having a first chamber extending
            along a first direction and a second chamber extending along a second direction, substantially
            perpendicular to the first direction; a ram block configured to move inside the first
            chamber, the ram block having a packer region and at least one channel that extends
            all the way through the ram block; a packer configured to be provided in the packer
            region to seal a tool provided inside the second chamber; and at least one double
            piston provided through the at least one channel so that a pressure from the well
            is transmitted to the packer.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another exemplary embodiment, there is a ram block configured to move
            inside a first chamber of a ram blowout preventer (BOP). The ram block includes a
            packer region and at least one channel that extends all the way through the ram block;
            a packer configured to be provided in the packer region to seal a tool provided inside
            a second chamber of the BOP; and at least one double piston provided through the at
            least one channel so that a pressure from a well to which the BOP is attached is directly
            transmitted to the packer.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to still another exemplary embodiment, there is a method for manufacturing
            a ram block for a ram blowout preventer. The method includes providing a ram block;
            forming a packer region in the ram block; forming at least one channel that extends
            all the way through the ram block; installing at least one double piston through the
            at least one channel; and installing a packer in the packer region so that a first
            piston side of the double piston contacts the packer when pressure is applied on a
            second piston side of the double piston.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to yet another exemplary embodiment, there is a method of operating a ram
            blowout preventer (BOP) for sealing a well. The method includes activating a primary
            system for closing a ram block to seal with a packer a tool provided in the BOP; and
            applying well pressure on a double piston provided through at least one channel of
            the ram block so that a first piston side of the double piston directly applies a
            corresponding force on the packer.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">The following description of the exemplary embodiments refers to the accompanying
            drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings identify the same or similar
            elements. The following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead,
            the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims. The following embodiments
            are discussed, for simplicity, with regard to the terminology and structure of a ram
            BOP. However, the embodiments to be discussed next are not limited to these systems,
            but may be applied to other systems, i.e., a gate valve.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">Reference throughout the specification to “one embodiment” or “an embodiment” means
            that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with
            an embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the subject matter disclosed.
            Thus, the appearance of the phrases “in one embodiment” or “in an embodiment” in various
            places throughout the specification is not necessarily referring to the same embodiment.
            Further, the particular features, structures or characteristics may be combined in
            any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to an exemplary embodiment, a ram BOP is configured to have ram blocks provided
            with at least one through-channel that accommodates a corresponding double piston.
            The double piston has a first face exposed to a fluid that is present in a wellbore
            and a second face that contacts a packer of the ram block. The pressure from the wellbore
            is exerted on the packer for a better sealing of a tool present in the BOP.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">Novel features of this ram BOP are now discussed with regard to the figures. figref[FIG. 1]
            	 illustrates a cut view of a BOP 
            <b>16</b>. The BOP 
            <b>16</b> has ram blocks 
            <b>20</b> configured to move along a longitudinal first chamber 
            <b>18</b>. A second chamber 
            <b>19</b>, substantially perpendicular on the first chamber 
            <b>18</b>, is configured to accommodate a tool 
            <b>21</b>, e.g., a drill line. The term “substantially” here means that even if the direction
            of the first chamber makes an angle in the range of 85 to 95 degrees with the direction
            of the second chamber, the two chambers are still considered perpendicular. Thus,
            the second chamber 
            <b>19</b> is open while the first chamber 
            <b>18</b> is closed. The ram blocks 
            <b>20</b> are shown closed on the tool 
            <b>21</b> inside the first chamber 
            <b>18</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">A primary activation mechanism for the ram blocks 
            <b>20</b> includes a closing chamber 
            <b>22</b> and an opening chamber 
            <b>24</b> (having a substantially zero volume when the ram blocks are closed as in figref[FIG. 1]
            	). A piston 
            <b>26</b> is provided between the closing chamber 
            <b>22</b> and the opening chamber 
            <b>24</b>. A rod 
            <b>28</b> is attached to the piston 
            <b>26</b> and is also configured to connect to the ram block 
            <b>20</b>. Thus, when pressure in the closing chamber 
            <b>22</b> overcomes the pressure in the opening chamber 
            <b>24</b>, the piston 
            <b>24</b> moves to left in figref[FIG. 1]
            	, closing the ram block 
            <b>20</b> (i.e., pressing the ram block on the drill line 
            <b>21</b>). This is the primary system for applying pressure on the ram blocks and on the packers.
            A packer 
            <b>30</b> is shown on a frontal face of the ram block 
            <b>20</b>. The packer 
            <b>30</b> contacts the drill line 
            <b>21</b> for a better seal.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0031" num="0030">When a pressure in the wellbore 
            <b>40</b> needs to be controlled, the ram blocks 
            <b>20</b> are closed. The increasing pressure in the wellbore 
            <b>40</b> determines the ram blocks 
            <b>20</b> to be pressed upward, i.e., along a Z direction in figref[FIG. 1]
            	. A seal 
            <b>31</b> is provided on an upper part of the ram block 
            <b>20</b> to achieve a seal between the ram block 
            <b>20</b> and a body 
            <b>42</b> of the ram BOP 
            <b>16</b>. A further seal 
            <b>44</b> may be provided to further increase the seal between the ram block and the body of
            the BOP. This means that a fluid present in the wellbore 
            <b>40</b>, e.g., mud, may enter the first chamber 
            <b>18</b> but should not be able to pass past the packer 
            <b>30</b> into a first region 
            <b>50</b> of the second chamber 
            <b>19</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0032" num="0031">The pressure of the wellbore that is present in the first chamber

         <p id="p-0037" num="0036">The packer may be a conventional one piece elastomer or a more sophisticated one as
            shown in figref[FIG. 7]
            	. The packer 
            <b>100</b> shown in figref[FIG. 7]
            	 has plural metallic inserts 
            <b>102</b> partially provided inside the elastomeric part 
            <b>104</b>. The profile of the metallic inserts 
            <b>102</b> and the flexibility of the elastomeric part 
            <b>104</b> make the packer 
            <b>100</b> to have a variable radius R. This means that a single packer 
            <b>100</b> (variable radius packer) is configured to mate with drill lines (or other tools)
            having various diameters. For such a packer, the secondary pressure mechanism discussed
            above is more advantageous than for a conventional one piece elastomer that is designed
            for a drill line having a given radius. Thus, the sealing of the variable radius packer
            
            <b>100</b> can be improved by using the channels 
            <b>70</b> and double piston

         <p id="p-0038" num="0037">One advantage provided by one or more of the exemplary embodiments presented above
            is now discussed. A shape of a face of some of the packers is elliptical. Thus, when
            the ram blocks are closed to seal a tool, the packers do not completely seal the tool
            due to this specific shape. This problem is illustrated in figref[FIG. 8]
            	. figref[FIG. 8]
            	 shows the at least one channel 
            <b>70</b> through the ram block

            <b>84</b> facing the packer 
            <b>30</b> and the second piston side 
            <b>86</b> facing a pressure well. As the packer 
            <b>30</b> does not completely seal a region A defined by an interface between the tool 
            <b>21</b> and the packer 
            <b>30</b>, the extra pressure applied by the well fluid at 
            <b>100</b> on the second piston side 
            <b>86</b> helps to bring the packer 
            <b>30</b> closer to the tool 
            <b>21</b> in region A as the first piston side 
            <b>84</b> directly presses the packer 
            <b>30</b> toward the tool 
            <b>21</b>. Thus, a better seal is achieved by using the double piston 
            <b>80</b>.
