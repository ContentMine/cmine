         The strike half pivots, relative to the mounting half, between a first pivotal position
         at least partially covering the channel and a second pivotal position exposing the
         channel and also slides relative to the mounting half, at least when the strike half
         is in the first pivotal position, between a first slide position obstructing pivotal
         movement of the strike half out of the first pivotal position and a second slide position
         permitting such movement. When the strike half is in the first pivotal position and
         the first slide position, a plunger strike surface on the strike half is in registration
         with and facing the plunger aperture.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Solenoid-driven metering systems are well known in the food service arts, and are
            used for metered dispensing of liquids such as cream and milk, and granular solids
            such as sugar, for beverages such as coffee and tea. Such systems are sold under the
            trademark SureShot Dispensing Systems® by A.C. Dispensing Equipment Inc., having an
            address at 100 Dispensing Way, Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia, Canada B4C 4H2.

         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">figref[FIGS. 1 to 2B]
            	 show an exemplary prior art solenoid-driven metering system 
            <b>10</b>. The metering system 
            <b>10</b> comprises a flexible dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b>, a plastic housing 
            <b>14</b> surrounding a portion of the dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b>, and a solenoid plunger 
            <b>16</b>. Other components of the solenoid-driven metering system, such as the solenoid itself,
            related control systems, the support structure and other elements have been omitted
            for clarity of illustration; these elements and their placement will be apparent to
            one skilled in the art.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring specifically to figref[FIG. 1]
            	, an upper end 
            <b>12</b>A of the dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b> communicates with a reservoir of the material to be metered (not shown) and a lower
            end 
            <b>12</b>B communicates with an outlet (not shown), which may simply be an open end of the
            dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b>. In a typical example, the reservoir is a flexible plastic bag containing milk or
            cream which is sealed except that it opens into an attached dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b> to allow the milk or cream to be dispensed. The dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b> is arranged generally vertically, with the upper end 
            <b>12</b>A above the lower end 
            <b>12</b>B, so that material will flow downwardly through the tube from the upper end 
            <b>12</b>A to the lower end 
            <b>12</b>B under the influence of gravity, unless the dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b> is constricted.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">The housing 
            <b>14</b> comprises two opposed halves 
            <b>14</b>A, 
            <b>14</b>B removably hingedly secured to one another in a clamshell arrangement by a hinge
            
            <b>18</b> and securable around the dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b> in a closed configuration. Two opposed channels 
            <b>20</b>A, 
            <b>20</b>B defined in the tube-receiving faces of the two opposed halves 
            <b>14</b>A, 
            <b>14</b>B cooperate to define a vertical passageway 
            <b>20</b> through the housing 
            <b>14</b> for the dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b>. The half 
            <b>14</b>A of the housing 
            <b>14</b> facing the solenoid plunger 
            <b>16</b> has a plunger aperture 
            <b>22</b> which exposes the dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b>. The housing 
            <b>14</b> is maintained in the closed configuration by a thumbscrew 
            <b>19</b> that is rotatably journalled in a bore (not shown) through the half 
            <b>14</b>B of the housing 
            <b>14</b> that does not face the solenoid plunger 
            <b>16</b> and is threadedly received in a correspondingly positioned threaded aperture 
            <b>21</b> (figref[FIG. 1]
            	) in the half 
            <b>14</b>A facing the solenoid plunger 
            <b>16</b>. The threaded aperture 
            <b>21</b> is formed in a metal insert 
            <b>23</b> which is in turn secured in a larger aperture in the half 
            <b>14</b>A facing the solenoid plunger 
            <b>16</b>, so as to provide improved strength relative to the plastic from which the housing
            
            <b>14</b> is formed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typically, a temperature sensor insert 
            <b>17</b> formed from aluminum is installed in the channel

            <b>14</b>A facing the solenoid plunger 
            <b>16</b>. The insert 
            <b>17</b> carries a temperature sensor such as a thermistor (not shown) and engages the dispensing
            tube 
            <b>12</b> so that the insert 
            <b>17</b> will assume the approximate temperature of the material in the dispensing tube 
            <b>12</b> and allow this temperature to be detected by the temperature sensor.

            <b>24</b>. The plunger head 
            <b>26</b> is formed from plastic and comprises a base 
            <b>28</b> secured to the armature shaft 
            <b>24</b>, four support members 
            <b>30</b>, a disc-shaped portion 
            <b>32</b> and a closure member 
            <b>34</b>. The support members 
            <b>30</b> are ogee-shaped and arranged in cruciform relation to one another, and extend outwardly
            from the base 
            <b>28</b> to support the disc-shaped portion 
            <b>30</b>, which in turn supports the closure member

            <b>16</b> may be maintained in this position by, for example, a suitable biasing member such
            as a spring (not shown). In this position, the closure member 
            <b>34</b> compresses the dispensing tube

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">A housing for a dispensing tube of a metering dispenser comprises a mounting half
            for mounting the housing to a metering dispenser and a strike half for receiving plunger
            strikes. The strike half is carried by the mounting half. The mounting half has a
            mounting half tube channel defined therein for receiving a dispensing tube and also
            has a mounting half tube channel for receiving a plunger, and the strike half has
            a plunger strike surface. The strike half is pivotally carried by the mounting half
            so as to be pivotable, relative to the mounting half, between a first pivotal position
            in which the strike half at least partially covers the mounting half tube channel
            and a second pivotal position in which the strike half exposes the mounting half tube
            channel. The strike half is further slidably carried by the mounting half so as to
            be slidable relative to the mounting half, at least when the strike half is in the
            first pivotal position, between a first slide position in which pivotal movement of
            the strike half relative to the mounting half from the first pivotal position toward
            the second pivotal position is obstructed, and a second slide position in which pivotal
            movement of the strike half relative to the mounting half from the first pivotal position
            to the second pivotal position is permitted. At least when the strike half is in the
            first pivotal position and in the first slide position, the plunger strike surface
            is in registration with and facing the plunger aperture to receive a plunger head.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the strike half is hingedly carried by the mounting half by way
            of a pivot extending between the mounting half and the strike half and on which the
            strike half is rotatably received so as to be rotatable about the pivot between the
            first pivotal position and the second pivotal position, and the strike half is further
            slidable along the pivot, at least when the strike half is in the first pivotal position,
            between the first slide position and the second slide position.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain embodiments, one of the mounting half and the strike half has at least
            one locking finger and the other one of the mounting half and the strike half has
            at least one latch arm extending therefrom, with each latch arm forming a receiving
            slot for receiving a respective locking finger. When the strike half is in the first
            pivotal position and the first slide position, each locking finger is in registration
            with its respective latch arm, inside the receiving slot formed by the respective
            latch arm, so that each latch arm engages its respective locking finger to obstruct
            movement of the strike half from the first pivotal position toward the second pivotal
            position. When the strike half is in the first pivotal position and the second slide
            position, each locking finger is out of registration with its respective latch arm
            and outside of the receiving slot formed by the respective latch arm whereby movement
            of the strike half from the first pivotal position toward the second pivotal position
            is permitted.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular embodiments, the at least one locking finger comprises a plurality of
            locking fingers spaced longitudinally apart from one another to define a locking finger
            gap between each adjacent pair of locking fingers, and the at least one latch arm
            comprises a plurality of latch arms spaced longitudinally apart from one another to
            define a latch arm gap between each adjacent pair of latch arms. When the strike half
            moves between the first pivotal position and the second pivotal position while in
            the second slide position, at least one latch arm fits in a corresponding locking
            finger gap, and at least one locking finger fits in a corresponding locking arm gap.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">The locking finger(s) or the latch arm(s), or both, may each have a tapered guide
            surface for guiding the strike half into the second slide position as the strike half
            moves into the first pivotal position.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the strike half has a strike half tube channel defined therein,
            and the strike half tube channel cooperates with the mounting half tube channel, when
            the strike half is in the first pivotal position, to form a dispensing tube channel.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">Reference is now made to figref[FIG. 3]
            	, which shows an exemplary housing 
            <b>300</b> for a dispensing tube of a metering dispenser (not shown). The housing 
            <b>300</b> comprises a mounting half 
            <b>302</b> for mounting the housing 
            <b>300</b> to a metering dispenser and a strike half 
            <b>304</b> for receiving plunger strikes, with the strike half 
            <b>304</b> being carried by the mounting half 
            <b>302</b>. The use of the terms “mounting half” and “strike half” refer to the clamshell structure
            of the housings described herein, and is not intended to imply that the mounting half
            and strike half are, or need be of equal size or identical shape. Indeed, as will
            be apparent from the drawings, in the exemplary illustrated embodiment the mounting
            half 
            <b>302</b> has a substantially larger footprint than the strike half 
            <b>304</b>. Both the mounting half 
            <b>302</b> and the strike half 
            <b>304</b> are preferably monolithic and are preferably formed from metal of suitable strength,
            more preferably from aluminum, and most preferably from anodized aluminum. Other materials,
            such as plastic of suitable strength, may also be used. The mounting half 
            <b>302</b> and the strike half 
            <b>304</b> may be made of different materials.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0043" num="0042">The strike half 
            <b>304</b> can move relative to the mounting half 
            <b>302</b> so that the housing 
            <b>300</b> has a closed and locked configuration (figref[FIGS. 3]
            	, 
            <b>4</b>, 
            <b>10</b>, 
            <b>12</b> and 
            <b>14</b> to 
            <b>16</b>), a closed and unlocked configuration (figref[FIGS. 9]
            	, 
            <b>11</b> and 
            <b>13</b>), and at least one open configuration (figref[FIGS. 5 and 6]
            	). To enable the housing 
            <b>300</b> to be placed into the various configurations, the strike half 
            <b>304</b> is both pivotally and slidably carried by the mounting half 
            <b>302</b>, as described in greater detail below. The mounting half 
            <b>302</b> and the strike half 
            <b>304</b> each have respective tube-receiving 
            <b>302</b>A, 
            <b>304</b>A and outer faces 
            <b>302</b>B, 
            <b>304</b>B. The outer face 
            <b>302</b>B of the mounting half may be mounted to a metering dispenser, and when the housing
            
            <b>300</b> is in the closed and locked configuration and in the closed and unlocked configuration,
            the tube-receiving faces 
            <b>302</b>A, 
            <b>304</b>A face one another.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0044" num="0043">As best shown in figref[FIGS. 4 and 5]
            	, in the illustrated embodiment the mounting half 
            <b>302</b> has a mounting half tube channel 
            <b>306</b> defined in its tube-receiving face 
            <b>302</b>A for receiving a flexible dispensing tube 
            <b>308</b> of the metering dispenser, and a plunger aperture 
            <b>310</b> is defined through the mounting half 
            <b>302</b>, and in particular through the mounting half tube channel 
            <b>306</b>, for receiving a plunger 
            <b>380</b> (see figref[FIGS. 15 and 16]
            	). The strike half 
            <b>304</b> has a strike half tube channel 
            <b>312</b> defined in its tube-receiving face 
            <b>304</b>A, and has a plunger strike surface 
            <b>314</b> (figref[FIG. 6]
            	) on the tube-receiving face 
            <b>304</b>A interrupting the strike half tube channel 
            <b>312</b>. In the illustrated embodiment in which the mounting half 
            <b>302</b> and the strike half 
            <b>304</b> are made from metal, in particular anodized aluminum, the plunger strike surface
            
            <b>314</b> is preferably integral with the monolithic strike half 
            <b>304</b>; in embodiments where the strike half 
            <b>304</b> is formed from a material not suitable for withstanding direct plunger strikes, a
            separate plunger strike plate may provide the plunger strike surface. While the exemplary
            embodiment in figref[FIGS. 3 to 16]
            	 shows the plunger strike surface 
            <b>314</b> as a recessed part the tube-receiving face 
            <b>304</b>A, in other embodiments the plunger strike surface may be coplanar with the remainder
            of the tube-receiving face aside from the strike half tube channel.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0045" num="0044">At least when the housing 
            <b>300</b> is in the closed and locked configuration (figref[FIGS. 3]
            	, 
            <b>4</b>, 
            <b>10</b>, 
            <b>12</b> and 
            <b>14</b> to 
            <b>16</b>) the strike half 
            <b>302</b> partially covers the mounting half 
            <b>302</b> so as to obstruct access to the mounting half tube channel 
            <b>306</b>, and the strike half tube channel 
            <b>312</b> cooperates with the mounting half tube channel 
            <b>306</b> to form a dispensing tube passage 
            <b>316</b> through the housing 
            <b>300</b>. The dispensing tube passage 
            <b>316</b> receives the dispensing tube 
            <b>308</b> of the metering dispenser and positions the dispensing tube 
            <b>308</b> for engagement by a plunger of the metering dispenser. Moreover, at least when the
            housing 
            <b>300</b> is in the closed and locked configuration (figref[FIGS. 3]
            	, 
            <b>4</b>,

            <b>16</b>) the plunger strike surface 
            <b>314</b> is in registration with the plunger aperture 
            <b>310</b> to receive a plunger head.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other embodiments, the strike half may omit any strike half tube channel, and the
            mounting half tube channel may be correspondingly deeper, so that the entire dispensing
            tube can be accommodated within the mounting half tube channel.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0047" num="0046">As noted above, the strike half 
            <b>304</b> is both pivotally and slidably carried by the mounting half 
            <b>302</b>. The strike half 
            <b>304</b> is pivotally carried by the mounting half 
            <b>302</b> so as to be pivotable, relative to the mounting half 
            <b>302</b>, between a first pivotal position in which the strike half 
            <b>304</b> at least partially covers the mounting half tube channel 
            <b>306</b> (figref[FIGS. 3]
            	, 
            <b>4</b> and

            	) in which the strike half 
            <b>304</b> exposes the mounting half tube channel 
            <b>306</b>. The strike half 
            <b>304</b> is further slidably carried by the mounting half 
            <b>302</b> so that, at least when the strike half 
            <b>304</b> is in the first pivotal position, the strike half 
            <b>304</b> is slidable, relative to the mounting half 
            <b>302</b>, between a first slide position (figref[FIGS. 3 to 6]
            	, 
            <b>10</b>, 
            <b>12</b> and 
            <b>14</b> to 
            <b>16</b>) and a second slide position (figref[FIGS. 7]
            	, 
            <b>9</b>, 
            <b>11</b> and 
            <b>13</b>). When the strike half 
            <b>304</b> is in the first slide position and is also in the first pivotal position (figref[FIGS. 3]
            	, 
            <b>4</b>, 
            <b>10</b>, 
            <b>12</b> and 
            <b>14</b> to 
            <b>16</b>), pivotal movement of the strike half 
            <b>304</b>, relative to the mounting half 
            <b>302</b>, from the first pivotal position toward the second pivotal position is obstructed.
            When the strike half 
            <b>304</b> is in the second slide position, pivotal movement of the strike half 
            <b>304</b> relative to the mounting half 
            <b>302</b> from the first pivotal position to the second pivotal position is permitted.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0048" num="0047">The angular distance between the second pivotal position and the first pivotal position
            of the strike half 
            <b>304</b> relative to the mounting half 
            <b>302</b> should be such that the strike half 
            <b>304</b> exposes the mounting half tube channel 
            <b>306</b> and hence the dispensing tube 
            <b>308</b>. As shown in solid lines in figref[FIG. 6]
            	, in the illustrated embodiment an angular distance of about 90 degrees from the first
            pivotal position is sufficient for the strike half 
            <b>304</b> to expose the mounting half tube channel 
            <b>306</b> and the dispensing tube 
            <b>308</b>. However, in the illustrated embodiment shown in figref[FIGS. 3 to 16]
            	, the second pivotal position of the strike half 
            <b>304</b> relative to the mounting half 
            <b>302</b>, shown with broken lines in figref[FIG. 6]
            	, has an angular distance slightly greater than 180 degrees from the first pivotal
            position. This provides greater access to the mounting half tube channel

         <p id="p-0056" num="0055">To facilitate locking and unlocking of the housing 
            <b>300</b>, the strike half 
            <b>304</b> should be slidable along the pivot

            strike half 
            <b>304</b> is in the first pivotal position. In the illustrated embodiment shown in figref[FIGS. 3 to 16]

            <b>302</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0057" num="0056">It is contemplated that in other embodiments (not shown), the strike half may only
            be able to slide between the first and second slide positions when the strike half
            is in or nearly in the first pivotal position. In one exemplary implementation, the
            pivot carrier that is lowermost when the housing is in an upright position may include
            a projecting portion extending toward the barrel to define a partial shoulder, and
            the end of the barrel closest to that pivot carrier may include a corresponding recess.
            In such an implementation, sliding of the barrel, and hence the strike half, would
            only be permitted when the projecting portion and recess were in registration with
            one another; when the projecting portion and recess were out of registration the shoulder
            on the projecting portion would engage the non-recessed part of the end of the barrel
            to prevent sliding of the barrel along the pivot and thereby prevent any substantial
            sliding of the strike half relative to the mounting half. Accordingly, by arranging
            the projecting portion and recess so that they will only be in registration when the
            strike half is in or nearly in the first pivotal position, the projecting portion
            will engage the end of the barrel to maintain the strike half in the second slide
            position unless the strike half is in or nearly in the first pivotal position. When
            the strike half is in or nearly in the first pivotal position, the projecting portion
            and recess will be in registration so that the projecting portion on the lowermost
            pivot carrier is received in the recess as the barrel slides toward that pivot carrier
            to enable the strike half to slide from the second slide position to the first slide
            position. Such an arrangement could also be constructed to prevent or inhibit the
            access portion from pivoting from the first pivotal position to the second pivotal
            position unless the access portion were in the second slide position, by arranging
            the projecting portion and the recess so that a side of the projecting portion would
            engage a side of the recess so as to block pivoting unless the access portion is in
            the second slide position.

            or alternatively can hold the strike half 
            <b>304</b> in the second slide position while replacing the dispensing tube 
            <b>308</b>. Once the reservoir and flexible dispensing tube 
            <b>308</b> have been replaced, the user then pivots the strike half 
            <b>304</b> from the second pivotal position through the intermediate pivotal position shown
            in figref[FIG. 7]
            	 toward the first pivotal position and, if the user has not held the strike half 
            <b>304</b> in the second slide position, slides the strike half 
            <b>304</b> into the second slide position. This enables the upper three latch arms 
            <b>342</b> to enter the corresponding locking finger gaps 
            <b>340</b> while the lower three locking fingers 
            <b>336</b> enter the corresponding latch arm gaps 
            <b>346</b>. Thus, when the strike half 
            <b>304</b> reaches the first pivotal position, the strike half 
            <b>304</b> will be in the second slide position and therefore in the closed and unlocked configuration
            (figref[FIGS. 9]
            	, 
            <b>11</b> and 
            <b>13</b>). The user can then either manually move the strike half 
            <b>304</b> into the first slide position or, where the strike half is heavy enough and can slide
            smoothly along the pivot 
            <b>328</b>, the user can simple release the strike half 
            <b>304</b> and allow it to fall into the first slide position under gravity, in either case
            returning the housing to closed and locked configuration (figref[FIGS. 3]
            	, 
            <b>4</b>, 
            <b>10</b>, 
            <b>12</b> and 
            <b>14</b> to 
            <b>16</b>). To enable the strike half 
            <b>304</b> to fall into the first slide position under gravity to transition from the closed
            and unlocked configuration to the closed and locked configuration, the clearance between
            the locking fingers 
            <b>336</b> and the receiving slots 
            <b>352</b> formed by the latch arms should be sufficient to enable the strike half 
            <b>304</b> to fall smoothly into place. The strike half 
            <b>304</b> includes an upper grip recess 
            <b>388</b> in its outer face 
            <b>304</b>B and a lower grip recess 
            <b>390</b> defined in the lower edge of the strike half 
            <b>304</b> to assist a user in grasping and moving the strike half 
            <b>304</b>.

            	, a pair of mounting bores 
            <b>356</b> are defined through the mounting half 
            <b>302</b> on either side of the mounting half tube channel 
            <b>306</b>. The mounting bores 
            <b>356</b> each include an intermediate annular shoulder 
            <b>358</b> (figref[FIG. 7]
            	) and can receive a bolt (not shown) for securing the mounting half

            <b>306</b> above the plunger aperture 
            <b>310</b>, for receiving a thermistor 
            <b>362</b> or other temperature sensor. Where the mounting half 
            <b>304</b> is made from aluminum or another suitable material having good thermal conductivity,
            the need for an insert made from such material is obviated.

         <p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, as best seen in figref[FIG. 6]
            	, a closure sensor aperture
