         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a supporting unit for an oil pump of a CVT. More
            particularly, the present invention relates to a supporting unit for an oil pump of
            a CVT which may improve mutual operability between an input shaft of a CVT and a rotating
            shaft of an oil pump.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, an oil pump of an automatic transmission may be classified into an external
            gear pump and an internal gear pump, and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)
            usually uses the external gear pump.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">The CVT is equipped with conical pulleys mounted to an input shaft and an output shaft
            respectively and gap of the conical pulleys is variable, and a belt or a chain is
            used for connecting the pulleys. In CVT, when the gap between the conical pulleys
            are increased, the belt or chain approaches to a center of the pulleys, and hydraulic
            pressure is applied to control the gap. And thus, the CVT usually requires an oil
            pump which may generate high hydraulic pressure within a small space. A rotating shaft
            of the oil pump is connected with an input shaft of the CVT by a chain or a belt for
            being supplied rotation of the input shaft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when the oil pump receives power from the input shaft of the CVT rotating
            at a high speed, the input shaft of the CVT and the rotating shaft of the oil pump
            may oscillate due to operation or rotation of the chain or supplied torque. Also,
            rotation of the chain may induce noise and vibration.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">The information disclosed in this Background of the Invention section is only for
            enhancement of understanding of the general background of the invention and should
            not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that this information
            forms the prior art already known to a person skilled in the art.

         <h1>BRIEF SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various aspects of the present invention are directed to provide a supporting unit
            for an oil pump of a CVT which may prevent oscillation of an input shaft of a CVT
            and a rotating shaft of an oil pump and also minimize noise and vibration.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an aspect of the present invention, the supporting unit apparatus for an oil pump
            of a continuously variable transmission (CVT) may include the CVT disposed in a transmission
            housing, wherein an input shaft and a CVT case cover thereof are disposed thereto,
            the oil pump which is disposed in the transmission housing independent from the CVT
            and of which a rotating shaft and an oil pump case cover are disposed thereto, a connecting
            member which engages the input shaft of the CVT and the rotating shaft of the oil
            pump for transmitting rotation of the input shaft to the rotating shaft, and a supporting
            unit which connects the CVT and the oil pump for preventing relative motion of the
            CVT and the oil pump.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The connecting member is a chain.</p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">An end of the supporting unit is connected to the CVT case cover, and another end
            of the supporting unit is connected to the oil pump case cover.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">The supporting unit may further include a stepped surface for connecting the CVT case
            cover and the oil pump case cover which form connecting surfaces that are not on the
            same level.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">The supporting unit connects a CVT case with the CVT case cover, and connects the
            oil pump with the oil pump case cover, wherein the supporting unit may further include
            a stepped surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">The supporting unit is formed as a plate shape.</p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">The supporting unit may further include a stepped surface for connecting the CVT case
            cover and the oil pump case cover which form connecting surfaces that are not on the
            same level.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">The supporting unit is formed as a hollow plate having a hole therein for preventing
            vibration and crack due to twist according to interaction between the CVT and the
            oil pump.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the supporting unit
            is equipped between the CVT and the oil pump for preventing oscillation of an input
            shaft of a CVT and a rotating shaft of an oil pump.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">And the supporting unit may maintain movement of a chain uniformly. And thus, the
            supporting unit may minimize noise and vibration due to movement of a chain or a belt.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">The methods and apparatuses of the present invention have other features and advantages

      <div>
         <h2>CLAIM-TEXT</h2>7. A supporting unit apparatus for an oil pump of a continuously variable transmission
         (CVT) comprising:
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>the CVT disposed in a transmission housing, wherein an input shaft and a CVT case
         cover thereof are disposed thereto;
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>the oil pump which is disposed in the transmission housing independent from the CVT
         and of which a rotating shaft and an oil sums case cover are disposed thereto;
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>a connecting member which engages the input shaft of the CVT and the rotating shaft
         of the oil pump for transmitting rotation of the input shaft to the rotating shaft;
         and
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>a supporting unit which connects the CVT and the oil pump for preventing relative
         motion of the CVT and the oil pump,
         
         <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>wherein the supporting unit is formed as a hollow plate having a hole therein for
         preventing vibration and crack due to twist according to interaction between the CVT
         and the oil pump.
         
      </div>
      
      
      <h2>claim</h2>
      
      <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>8. The supporting unit apparatus of claim-ref[claim 7]
      	, wherein the connecting member is a chain.
      
      
      <h2>claim</h2>
      
      <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>9. The supporting unit apparatus of claim-ref[claim 7]
      	, wherein the supporting unit connects a CVT case with the CVT case cover, and connects
      the oil pump with the oil pump case cover.
      
      
      <h2>claim</h2>
      
      <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>10. The supporting unit apparatus of claim-ref[claim 9]
      	, wherein the supporting unit further includes a stepped surface.
      
      
      <h2>claim</h2>
      
      <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>11. The supporting unit apparatus of claim-ref[claim 7]
      	, wherein the supporting unit is formed as a plate shape.
      
      
      <h2>claim</h2>
      
      <i>CLAIM-TEXT:</i>12. The supporting unit apparatus of claim-ref[claim 7]
      	, wherein the supporting unit further includes a stepped surface for connecting the
