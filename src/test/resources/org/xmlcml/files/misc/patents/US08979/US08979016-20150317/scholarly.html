      <p>Methods and apparatus for vertical or short takeoff and landing. In one embodiment,
         the apparatus comprises two or more counter driven rings with one or more airfoils
         attached. In one variant, there is an upper ring and a lower ring, each with multiple
         airfoils attached. In one variant, lift is generated largely via ambient air currents,
         allowing for long term on-station operation of the device.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field</p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates generally to the fields of aviation and aerospace engineering.
            More particularly, in one exemplary aspect, the present disclosure is directed to
            methods and apparatus for vertical short takeoff and landing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of Related Technology</p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">A wide range of aviation related applications require flexibility in aircraft movement.
            Common requirements are vertical or short takeoff, hovering capabilities, and frequent
            changes in flight vector, etc. Additionally, unmanned aircraft are in high demand
            for defense or other applications (such as drug surveillance or interdiction) in which
            deploying personnel is either too dangerous or impractical given the task requirements.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is impossible to design aircraft that meet the needs of every aviation application.
            Therefore, having a wide variety aircraft designs utilizing a wide variety of flight
            systems (e.g. propulsion, takeoff, landing etc) is necessary to match the requirements
            of a multitude of tasks. However, given monetary constraints, there is a practical
            limit to the number of aircraft that can be manufactured and dedicated to any specific
            purpose or group. Therefore, it is important that selected designs offer the broadest
            task flexibility possible, while not overlapping unduly with aircraft already in widespread
            use.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Existing solutions for vertical short takeoff and landing (VSTOL) generally either
            comprise: (i) those driven by a main rotor stabilized via a tail rotor (e.g., helicopter),
            (ii) more traditional airplane driven by engines or turbines the can be placed in
            multiple orientations (e.g., V-22 Osprey or Harrier jets), or (iii) small craft dependent
            on one or more turbines (Multipurpose Security and Surveillance Mission Platform or
            SoloTrek Exo-Skeletor Flying Vehicle). While the more traditional plane designs offer
            high-top speeds, and increase mission range/duration via gliding capabilities, these
            systems are limited in the speed at which they can accommodate a significant change
            in flight vector. Thus, these vehicles would be inappropriate for e.g., low-altitude
            applications in an urban environment. Conversely, helicopters and smaller turbine
            based craft lack the capability to remain aloft without expending significant power
            or fuel resources to keep their turbines running. Moreover, all of these vehicles
            have a preferred orientation such that if they become inverted, the craft will have
            to be righted before lift capability can be restored.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">Unfortunately, modern applications often require both flight through confined areas
            and long on-station dwell or long-range deployment of the aircraft. Moreover, vehicles
            used in such applications may often experience violent disruptions or turbulence in
            their immediate airspace. Thus, losing lift capability as a result of environmental
            conditions or an unexpected inversion is a significant operational limitation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, improved solutions are required for VSTOL. Such improved solutions should
            ideally be flexible enough for urban or other confined area navigation, be able to
            generate lift in multiple orientations, and have suitable on-station dwell and range
            operational capacity.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure satisfies the aforementioned needs by providing, inter alia,
            improved methods and apparatus for vertical short takeoff and landing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a first aspect of the disclosure, a vertical short takeoff and landing apparatus
            is disclosed. In one embodiment, the apparatus comprises multiple (e.g., two) contra-rotating
            rings with attached airfoils, a fuselage, a power source, and a self-contained motor
            and drive system. The contra-rotating rings with attached airfoils rotate about the
            center axis of the apparatus and generate lift.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one variant, the capability of generating lift primarily from ambient air currents
            is introduced. This allows the vehicle to, inter alia, stay aloft with minimal or
            even no energy consumption.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a second aspect of the disclosure, methods of operating the apparatus are disclosed.</p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a third aspect of the disclosure, a lift generating mechanism is disclosed. In
            one embodiment, the mechanism comprises at least two contra-rotating rings having
            a plurality of airfoils disposed on each. In one variant, the airfoils may individually
            (or in unison) change pitch or attitude. In another variant, the airfoils may also
            extend radially from the rings so as to increase the effective diameter of the apparatus.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a fourth aspect of the disclosure, an airfoil mechanism is disclosed. In one variant,
            the mechanism comprises a plurality of airfoils disposed on the aforementioned contra-rotating
            rings and each configured to articulate around a rotational axis, each of the axes
            being oriented radially with respect to the ring(s). In another variant, the airfoil
            mechanisms are each radially extendable, such that the effective airfoil surface area
            is increased.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a fifth aspect of the disclosure, business methods relating to the apparatus are
            disclosed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a sixth aspect of the disclosure, an apparatus for the remote operation of the
            VSTOL apparatus is disclosed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a seventh aspect of the disclosure, a method for generating lift with the VSTOL
            apparatus is disclosed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an eighth aspect of the disclosure, methods of controlling the VSTOL apparatus
            are disclosed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a ninth aspect of the disclosure, a method of operating the VSTOL apparatus to
            utilize prevailing air currents to generate lift is disclosed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a tenth aspect, a low-observable VSTOL apparatus is disclosed.</p>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an eleventh aspect of the disclosure, a method of reducing the radar cross section
            (RCS) of the VSTOL aircraft during flight is disclosed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a twelfth aspect of the disclosure, an extensible airfoil apparatus is disclosed.</p>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a thirteenth aspect of the disclosure, a lift generation system is disclosed. In
            one embodiment the system comprises: (i) one or more pairs of rings, (ii) a plurality
            of airfoils disposed on the rings, and (iii) a drive apparatus configured to contra-rotate
            each of the pairs of rings. The lift generation system is configured to generate lift
            via airflow around the airfoils during contra rotation of the pairs of rings.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a fourteenth aspect of the disclosure, a non-transitory computer readable medium
            configured to store at least one computer program thereon is disclosed. In one embodiment,
            the computer program comprises a plurality of instructions configured to, when executed:
            control various aspects of the operation of a VSTOL apparatus such as by use of airfoil
            attitude control. In one variant, the computer program takes in physical input signals
            such as from an altimeter, accelerometer(s), electronic or electromagnetic compass,
            etc., and controls the flight of the VSTOL apparatus.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one variant, the various aspects include automated piloting of the VSTOL apparatus.</p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another variant, the various aspects include assisting and translating remote piloting
            instructions received from a remote source.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">In yet another variant, the various aspects include control of sensory equipment disposed
            on the VSTOL apparatus.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0031" num="0030">Other features and advantages of the present disclosure will immediately be recognized
            by persons of ordinary skill in the art with reference to the attached drawings and

         <p id="p-0063" num="0062">Reference is now made to the drawings, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout.</p>
         <p id="h-0007" num="0000">Overview</p>
         <p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides methods and apparatus for vertical
            short takeoff and landing (VSTOL). In one embodiment, the apparatus uses contra-rotating
            rings (e.g., two) with a plurality of articulating airfoils attached at the circumference
            of each to generate lift. The apparatus can be driven by one or more electric motors
            supplied by photovoltaic (solar) cells, one or more battery cells, by a combustion
            engine (e.g., two-stroke, four stroke, or even turbojet), or alternatively via satellite
            downlink supplying an electromagnetic (e.g., microwave range) radiation beam which
            would each supply power to a drive arrangement that is completely contained within
            the apparatus.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another aspect, the aircraft is configured to reduce its motor function and use
            prevailing wind currents to maintain altitude and position and/or generate lift.
         </p>
         <p id="h-0008" num="0000">Detailed Description of Exemplary Embodiments</p>
         <p id="p-0066" num="0065">Exemplary embodiments are now described in detail. While these embodiments are primarily
            discussed in the context of an unmanned military aircraft, it will be recognized by
            those of ordinary skill that the present disclosure is not so limited. In fact, the
            various aspects are useful for vertical short takeoff and landing from in a variety
            other contexts. For example, embodiments may be readily adapted for use as remote
            viewing and/or other sensory aids (e.g., audio, IR, ionizing, radiation, electromagnetic
            radiation such as wireless communications) for law enforcement, drug interdiction,
            or private investigators. Similarly, embodiments could be used for opportunistic video
            equipment deployment (sport events, disaster areas, or zones too dangerous for personnel
            such as over high radiation areas).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0067" num="0066">Furthermore, while the disclosure is discussed primarily in the context of generating
            lift in a gaseous fluid medium such as the earth's atmosphere, it will be recognized
            by those of ordinary skill that the architectures and principle disclosed herein could
            be readily adapted for use in other operating environments, such as liquids, with
            the discussion using gaseous mediums merely being exemplary.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0068" num="0067">It will also be recognized that while particular dimensions may be given for the apparatus
            or its components, the apparatus may advantageously be scaled to a variety of different
            sizes, depending on the intended application. For instance, the disclosure contemplates
            a small table-top or even hand-held variant which may be useful for e.g., low altitude
            surveillance or the like. Likewise, a large-scale variant is contemplated, which may
            carry a more extensive array of sensors and even weapons (such as e.g., Hellfire precision
            guided munitions or the like), have greater loiter and altitude capabilities, etc.
            This design scalability is one salient advantage of the apparatus.

         <p id="h-0009" num="0000">Exemplary Apparatus and Operation—</p>
         <p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring now to figref[FIG. 1]
            	, an exemplary embodiment of a lift mechanism 
            <b>100</b> for a VSTOL apparatus is shown and described in detail. The lift mechanism of figref[FIG. 1]
            	 includes two (2) counter driven rings disposed in parallel, including an upper 
            <b>103</b> and a lower ring 
            <b>104</b>. Attached to the upper and lower ring are upper airfoils 
            <b>101</b> and lower airfoils 
            <b>102</b>, respectively. Each of the airfoils generally has a curved shape such that it is
            capable of generating lift while being rotated through the surrounding air. Accordingly,
            as the upper and lower rings of the mechanism 
            <b>100</b> spin, the airfoils create lift (or alternatively downdraft, or negative lift, depending
            on the orientation of the airfoils as discussed infra). Each of the airfoils includes
            a generally curved or rounded leading edge and a narrower trailing edge portion. In
            the embodiment illustrated, the upper airfoils curved leading edge is positioned such
            that the upper rotating ring will generate lift by rotating in a counter clockwise
            direction (when viewed from above). Conversely, the lower airfoils curved leading
            edge is positioned such that the lower rotating ring generates lift by rotating in
            the opposite direction (i.e. clockwise). While a specific configuration is shown,
            it is appreciated that the leading edges for the upper and lower airfoils could be
            reversed such that an opposite rotation (i.e. clockwise rotation for the upper airfoils
            and counter clockwise rotation for the lower airfoils) will generate lift for the
            VSTOL apparatus.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring now to figref[FIG. 1]
            	
            <i>a</i>, a configuration with four airfoils per ring is shown 
            <b>110</b>. This configuration allows the lift system to be optimized with respect to the shape
            and scale of the apparatus, although other airfoil shapes and sizes, and/or number
            of airfoils may be employed depending on the desired characteristics).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0071" num="0070">As the upper and lower rings rotate in opposite directions and are essentially identical
            in construction (albeit in a reversed orientation), the combined motion of the rings
            generates no net torque on the apparatus when the upper and lower rings are rotated
            at the same speed. This is useful in that additional rotors, or rotors oriented in
            an orthogonal orientation (such as that seen in conventional helicopters) are not
            necessary in order to provide counter rotation. In addition, by varying the relative
            speeds of the counter rotating rings, a net torque can be generated, thereby allowing
            the VSTOL apparatus to rotate about a central (vertical) axis, again without necessitating
            an additional rotor.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, the multiple rings allow for increased lift capability, because they
            allow for more points for lift generation. Furthermore, as will be appreciated later
            in the specification. The coordination of the upper and lower airfoil elements leads
            to a synergistic improvement of lift capacity. Considerations related to this coordination
            of upper and lower airfoils (including ring spacing, airfoil shape, rotational speed,
            etc.) can aid in effective airfoil/ring design that e.g., maximizes upward lift.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring now to figref[FIG. 2]
            	, a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of the VSTOL apparatus of figref[FIG. 1]
            	 is shown, with a disc-shaped fuselage 
            <b>201</b> supported within the rings. This placement of the fuselage with respect to the rings
            is effective in that as previously discussed, no torque will be imparted on the fuselage,
            thereby keeping it substantially fixed in orientation during flight. Thus, the centro-symmetric
            design allows for a highly agile aircraft, because actions such as turning can be
            performed with effectively a zero radius and with only minimal power expenditure.
            For example, a brake (e.g., frictional mechanism) could be applied to the one or more
            of the rotating rings or a power ring. This would result in axial rotation and turn
            the aircraft. Furthermore, to tilt the aircraft, the airfoils can be articulated at
            control points to increase or decrease the amount of lift they generate. Thus, more
            or less lift is generated from one side of the aircraft, and the VSTOL apparatus would
            tilt. See discussion of figref[FIG. 3]
            	
            <i>b </i>below.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring now to figref[FIG. 2]
            	
            <i>a</i>, a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of the VSTOL apparatus of figref[FIG. 1]
            	
            <i>a </i>is shown. In this configuration, a frame for supporting a fuselage is shown 
            <b>220</b>. The upper and lower portions of the frame are each surrounded by a pair of rotating
            rings (
            <b>223</b> and 
            <b>224</b>). Each pair of rings is rotated in tandem and, as discussed infra, are used to control
            the articulation of the airfoils in some embodiments.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, the placement of the fuselage in the embodiment of figref[FIG. 2]
            	 also reduces the strain experienced by the airfoils. Furthermore, the lack of a central
            hub or axle increases room for both sensors and cargo (e.g., munitions).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0076" num="0075">Another key advantage of this design is that it facilitates an aerodynamic fuselage.
            The disc shape allows for a large volume while still maintaining a relatively small
            cross-section with respect to the direction of transverse flight (e.g., laterally).
            This will lead to reduced power loss due to drag, and a reduced radar cross section
            (RCS) as discussed in greater detail subsequently herein.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0077" num="0076">It can also be appreciated that advantages from gear reduction (e.g., between the
            output shaft of the drive source, such as a motor or engine, and the drive applied
            to the rings) can easily be leveraged using the contra-rotating ring design described
            herein. In fact, the rings themselves can act as the main reduction gears given that
            the drive system of the VSTOL apparatus is located entirely within the circumference
            of the rings.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0078" num="0077">The fuselage comprises in one embodiment the power source (e.g., solar cell, battery,
            or engine, etc.) and motor(s) to drive the rotation of the rings, and to articulate
            the airfoils. In the illustrated embodiment, the fuselage is designed for unmanned
            operation, although it could conceivably house a cockpit for a passenger if the size
            of the aircraft was sufficient to lift such weights effectively. In either of these
            implementations, a host of weapon or surveillance systems may also be housed in the
            fuselage, again limited by an appropriate size and lift capacity. Weapons bays may
            also be internalized within the fuselage (e.g., akin to those on the F-22 Raptor)
            if desired, thereby reducing aerodynamic drag and RCS.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment, the fuselage is made from a lightweight composite material (e.g.,
            graphite-based or urethane-based using epoxies as bonding agents) for both strength
            and reduced weight, although other materials may be used.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0080" num="0079">The fuselage may also be adapted to house autonomous navigation equipment, such as
            a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and computerized navigation system. This
            would be required to varying degrees depending on the level of autonomy desired. The
            fuselage may also house a computer configured to control and operate the VSTOL apparatus
            (i.e., altitude, attitude, pitch of the airfoils, etc.), whether with or without human
            or other external input. Such a system might use an external communication link such
            as a ground-based or satellite based wireless link. The fuselage may also house onboard
            instruments for navigation e.g. laser ranging systems, electro-optic or IR machine
            vision, altimeter, radar, gyroscopes, and/or optical gyroscopes, etc.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0081" num="0080">In other configurations, all or a subset of the airfoils may have their pitch adjusted
            with respect to the rings; e.g., they may rotate around their axis of attachment to
            the ring. Using control rings, the variable airfoil pitch can be adjusted allowing
            for lift control. Referring now to the perspective view in figref[FIG. 3]
            	, the airfoils 
            <b>301</b>, 
            <b>302</b> on the apparatus are shown having been articulated (rotated generally around their
            attachment axes—not shown, but described below). Specifically, the upper ring airfoils
            
            <b>301</b> have been rotated counter-clockwise (when viewed from their end), while the lower
            ring airfoils 
            <b>302</b> have been rotated clockwise. These two rotations provide additional lift for each
            ring, respectively.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0082" num="0081">Similarly, figref[FIG. 3]
            	
            <i>a </i>shows the directions of motion and articulation for the airfoils in the embodiment
            depicted in figref[FIG. 1]
            	
            <i>a. </i>
         </p>
         <p id="p-0083" num="0082">It can be appreciated that in some versions, only the airfoils 
            <b>301</b> on the upper ring (or conversely those 
            <b>302</b> on the lower ring) could be articulated. While in other designs, the airfoils 
            <b>301</b> and 
            <b>302</b> on both the upper and lower rings can be articulated.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one implementation of the VSTOL apparatus (shown in figref[FIG. 3]
            	
            <i>a </i>and figref[FIG. 3]
            	
            <i>b</i>), three control points are used on the control ring 
            <b>303</b> (discussed in greater detail below). The control ring rotates with the power ring
            
            <b>304</b>; however, it is independent of the power ring's horizontal constraint (i.e., requirement
            that the power ring maintain a substantially fixed horizontal position). When one
            of the aforementioned control points has been articulated (center arrow in figref[FIG. 3]
            	
            <i>b</i>), just the control ring moves, changing the pitch of the airfoils (within that control
            point's affected area). The other two control points remain fixed (unless they too
            are actuated or controlled).

            <i>c </i>illustrates another embodiment of the exemplary airfoil. In this embodiment, radially
            extensible airfoils 
            <b>350</b> are used so as to permit the effective length of the airfoil to change. In one variant,
            the extensible portion 
            <b>352</b> slides outward from within the non-extensible portion 
            <b>354</b>, thereby increasing the effective length (and hence lift provided by) each airfoil.
            Such extensibility may be desirable for e.g., changing altitude, operating at different
            altitudes (i.e., having different air densities), changing the efficiency of the apparatus,
            maneuvering, altering the radar cross-section (RCS) of the aircraft, etc. In one implementation,
            the extension is provided by a rod 
            <b>356</b> mounted to the inner radius of the extensible portion 
            <b>352</b> on one end, and to a retraction/extension mechanism on the other (e.g., a screw or
            worm drive gear, hydraulic actuator, electromagnetic solenoid, etc.). In another variant,
            one or more springs are used such that centrifugal force of the rotating rings (and
            airfoils) tends to pull the extensible portions 
            <b>352</b> outward against spring force, such that greater extension (and lift (is achieved
            at greater ring rotational speeds. Various other schemes for controlling the position
            of the extensible portion 
            <b>352</b> will be recognized by those of ordinary skill given the present disclosure.

         <p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring now to figref[FIG. 4]
            	, a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of an apparatus for articulating the
            airfoils 
            <b>101</b>, 
            <b>102</b> is shown and described. In this embodiment, the pitch of the airfoils (i.e., angle
            with respect to the plane of ring rotation) is controlled via two rods. One rod 
            <b>401</b> penetrates radially at the tail of the airfoil, and the other rod 
            <b>402</b> penetrates at the front portion of the airfoil. One rod 
            <b>401</b> is attached to a control element 
            <b>403</b> (e.g., control ring) and is capable of moving up or down with respect to the main
            rotating ring (figref[FIG. 1]
            	, 
            <b>103</b> or 
            <b>104</b>) on which the airfoil is mounted. The second rod

            with respect to the ring on which the airfoil is mounted. A slot

            <b>402</b> to move therein when the control element 
            <b>403</b> is moved up or down. In this fashion, when the control element 
            <b>403</b> is moved upward or downward relative to the second element 
            <b>404</b>, the angle of the airfoil decreases or increases, respectively. The tail of the airfoil

         <p id="p-0087" num="0086">It will be recognized that the foregoing functionality may be realized alternatively
            by inverting the connections of the rods; i.e., the second rod

            <b>403</b>, and the first rod to the second element 
            <b>404</b>, such that the movement described above produces the inverted response (i.e., upward
            movement increases angle, etc.)
         </p>
         <p id="p-0088" num="0087">Likewise, the functions of the control elements can be changed. For instance, using
            the configuration shown in figref[FIG. 4]
            	, instead of maintaining the inner (second) control element fixed and moving the outer
            (first) element, the outer element 
            <b>403</b> can be fixed, and the inner (second) element 
            <b>404</b> can be moved up and down.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0089" num="0088">Moreover, the foregoing functions could be served by the actual rings (
            <b>103</b> or 
            <b>104</b>) as opposed to one or more of the control elements 
            <b>403</b>, 
            <b>404</b>. Alternatively, a pair a rings rotating in unison, but free to move with respect
            to one another in the direction orthogonal to the rotational plane, would be able
            to function as both of the platforms (
            <b>403</b> and 
            <b>404</b>). More detailed descriptions of such embodiments will be provided later in the specification.

            <i>a</i>, details of an exemplary configuration of an articulation system for the airfoils
            is shown. This system uses the two control rod mechanism shown in figref[FIG. 4]
            	. In the embodiment of figref[FIG. 4]
            	
            <i>a</i>, the articulation system is driven by a stepper motor 
            <b>409</b> which turns a screw thread 
            <b>410</b>. The screw thread controls the position of two wheels (
            <b>411</b> and 
            <b>412</b>). These wheels then depress or raise the rings they are in contact with. This alters
            the relative position of the two rings, and articulates the airfoils.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0092" num="0091">It can be appreciated that alternatively, the screw thread can be used to drive mechanics
            inside the rotating rings. Thus, the airfoils can be positioned without changing the
            relative position of the rings. Furthermore, the screw thread and wheel combination
            can be used to position localized portions of the rotating rings. Thus, in some embodiments,
            the airfoils can be positioned independently of one another.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0093" num="0092">In other versions, the first control element moves along the arc of a circle or ellipse
            or other function to facilitate rotation of the airfoil. The airfoils may also be
            allowed to translate at least somewhat in the circumferential direction if desired.
            Such features allow for more fluid positioning.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring now to figref[FIG. 5]
            	 and figref[FIG. 5]
            	
            <i>a</i>, the tail of the airfoil of figref[FIG. 4]
            	 is shown in its fully lowered position

            <i>a</i>, the tail of the airfoil is shown in its fully raised position 
            <b>601</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0095" num="0094">It can also be appreciated that the airfoils can comprise flaps, slats, or other extensible
            control surfaces that can be expanded or contracted to change the shape of the airfoils.
            The change is shape can be used to reduce or increase the lift achieved through the
            airfoils. Moreover, deicing can be achieved by altering the shape of the airfoils,
            potentially loosening built-up ice.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0096" num="0095">In yet another variant, the airfoils are substantially deformable in shape via internal
            mechanisms. Unlike the “flap” variant referenced above (which basically exaggerates
            the shape of the airfoil by extending the tail portion outward so that the leading
            edge to tail edge distance increases), the actual curvature of the airfoil can be
            altered mid-flight so that the Bernoulli effect (and/or other aerodynamic properties)
            are altered as desired. In one implementation, the outer surface of the airfoils comprises
            a substantially pliable polymer “skin” laid over a frame, the latter being mechanically
            deformable in shape by way of one or more articulated joints. Yet other approaches
            will be recognized by those of ordinary skill given the present disclosure.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0097" num="0096">Other potential implementations may utilize airfoil flaps that can be extended or
            retracted to change the shape of the airfoils. Through this airfoil extension and
            contraction, the aerodynamic cross-section of the apparatus can be altered to facilitate
            lift via e.g., ambient air currents.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0098" num="0097">As yet another option, the airfoils may be constructed so as to have a changing pitch/curvature
            as a function of radial position. For example, in one such variant, the pitch or curvature
            of the airfoil near the root about which it rotates may be one value, while the curvature
            changes as the distal (outward) end of the airfoil is approached; i.e., as if one
            grasped the end of the airfoil and twisted it so as to distort its shape. Such varying
            curvature may provide desired attributes in certain applications; e.g., greater lift
            as a function of rotational or angular velocity.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring now to figref[FIG. 7]
            	, a top perspective view of the exemplary VSTOL apparatus is, including a support
            frame comprising three upper support beams 
            <b>701</b> joined at the top of the apparatus by a substantially triangular platform 
            <b>702</b>. The three upper support beams are connected to a lower triangular support frame
            
            <b>703</b> via three multi-wheel mounts 
            <b>704</b>. These wheel mounts allow comprise upper wheels

            <b>706</b> wheels and lower wheels

            <b>709</b> for allowing the rotating rings to spin, while the frame supporting the fuselage
            stays stationary.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0100" num="0099">The exemplary support frame of figref[FIG. 7]
            	 is formed of a lightweight alloy such as a Titanium alloy, although other materials
            may be used, including polymers (e.g., plastics) or even composites such as carbon
            fiber composites of the type well known in the aircraft arts.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0101" num="0100">The configuration of figref[FIG. 7]
            	 offers increased structural integrity, while still meeting the stringent weight requirements
            of the VSTOL apparatus. Specifically, such frame-type construction offers high stability
            with the adding the cost or weight of full sheets of material. However, it should
            be noted that full sheets of material can offer advantages in other areas (e.g. armor,
            aerodynamic drag, optical or electromagnetic shielding, etc.). Hence, while the embodiment
            of figref[FIG. 7]
            	 is illustrated with only a lightweight support frame, it will also be recognized
            that either (i) the frame may be used with a covering or “skin”, (ii) the support
            frame may be minimized (such as by using very rigid materials, with only a central
            support “triangle” (not shown), with or without a skin, or (iii) the skin itself may
            be used to provide the necessary rigidity/support for the airframe. For example, the
            exemplary fuselage shape of figref[FIG. 2]
            	 herein may be formed via an outer skin with sufficient rigidity, such as via a strong,
            lightweight alloy or composite, thereby saving appreciable weight.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0102" num="0101">As previously noted, the upper and lower rings (
            <b>708</b> and 
            <b>709</b>) used in this design operate as the platforms for articulating the airfoils (
            <b>403</b> and 
            <b>404</b>). This configuration significantly simplifies the articulation process. In one variant,
            each “ring” comprises a pair of rings, which rotate in unison; i.e., one stationary
            main ring, and one control ring that moves perpendicular to the plane of rotation
            (i.e., up and down). The tail rod 
            <b>401</b> of the airfoils is attached to the control ring, and the forward rod 
            <b>402</b> of the airfoils is attached to the stationary ring. The airfoils then will rotate
            as the control ring moves up and down in the direction perpendicular to the direction
            of rotation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0103" num="0102">It can be appreciated that more control rings could also be added to the apparatus.
            Thus, individual airfoils could be attached to individual control rings. This would
            allow for independent control of each airfoil. However, in many configurations it
            might be more advantageous to attach airfoils to rings in such a manner that the center
            of the ring and its preferred axis of rotation are aligned. This will eliminate unwanted
            torque generated from non-ideal rotation. Therefore, it may be advantageous to control
            at least a pair of airfoils with each control ring. Conversely, the torques generated
            from this non-ideal rotation could be compensated by the complementary contra-rotation
            of the opposing set of rings.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0104" num="0103">Other more reductive designs can also be used. In one such exemplary embodiment, a
            ring-shaped internal frame is used, such as that of figref[FIG. 8]
            	. Referring now to figref[FIG. 8]
            	, upper and lower exterior wheels 
            <b>801</b> and

            <b>805</b>. Interior upper 
            <b>806</b> and lower

            <b>808</b> and 
            <b>809</b> lower interior rings. Similarly, the exterior and interior rings serve as the platforms
            
            <b>403</b> and 
            <b>404</b> for airfoil articulation.

         <p id="p-0105" num="0104">The ring shaped-frame used in the configuration of figref[FIG. 8]
            	 is an effective pairing with an aerodynamic fuselage. Moreover, this configuration
            does not define the bounds or contours of the fuselage. Thereby, such parameters can
            be instead defined by the particular needs of any given fuselage configuration (e.g.
            weapons/sensor storage, cockpit, drive systems, etc.).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0106" num="0105">Referring now to figref[FIG. 9]
            	, in another configuration, the ring-shaped internal frame in the previous embodiment
            is made using an economical, lightweight wire-frame 
            <b>901</b>. It can be made from a wide selection of materials (plastics, metals, metal-alloys,
            crystalline materials, fiberglass, etc., or some combination thereof). The ring-shaped
            internal wireframe is reinforced with three upper wireframe beams 
            <b>902</b> and three lower wireframe beams 
            <b>903</b>. Using such wireframes, the apparatus can more easily meet weight and structural
            integrity requirements. In addition, wireframe beams are more space efficient than
            more conventional beams (such as those of figref[FIG. 7]
            	). Wireframes can be adapted to house communications or surveillance equipment 
            <b>904</b>. Alternatively, the frame can be co-opted, and serve as a portion of e.g., an RF
            antenna for a communications system.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0107" num="0106">The dark coloration of the rings, airfoils, and frame in the embodiment of figref[FIG. 9]
            	 arises from the fact that they are made from (and/or coated in) a material that is
            impedance matched to the upper atmosphere to lower the radar signature (RCS) of the
            apparatus. A number of non-radar reflective or radar absorptive materials could suit
            this purpose (e.g. ferromagnetic materials or nanoparticle coatings). Furthermore,
            in some embodiments, the curved features of the VSTOL apparatus are flattened into
            polygonal approximations to reduce diffuse reflections off of the device. Thus, radiation
            is less likely to be reflected back in its direction of origin. Moreover, surfaces
            which would tend to reflect incident radar back to its source or other receiver can
            be angled or shaped so as to minimize such reflections. For instance, the flat or
            vertical outer surfaces of the rotating rings can be approximated by two oblique intersecting
            angled surfaces, as can the outward edge of each of the airfoils. In that radar is
            most likely to impinge in the craft from the side (or somewhat below and to the side
            when the aircraft is at altitude), these surfaces become most critical.

         <p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the illustrated embodiment, the Control Equipment (CE) comprises a wireless transceiver
            
            <b>1004</b> connected to a user interface 
            <b>1002</b>, the latter receiving operator (or computer, as described in greater detail below)
            inputs for control of the device. The transceiver then relays commands from the interface
            to a transceiver 
            <b>1006</b> located on the VSTOL apparatus, which is in communication with an on-board controller
            
            <b>1008</b>. The wireless link may be direct (e.g., LOS or curved propagation via the earth's

            land-based tower(s), not shown, or satellite 
            <b>1010</b>).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0111" num="0110">It is also envisaged that forward link and/or reverse link data could be transmitted

            (e.g., eNodeB), Wi-Fi hotspot, WiMAX transceiver, etc., such that the VSTOL apparatus
            could be operated remotely over an existing network such as the Internet.

         <p id="p-0112" num="0111">For a human operated interface, one or more joysticks can be used to input commands.
            Joysticks would offer a degree of familiarity that might help operators of other aircraft
            acclimate to controlling the VSTOL apparatus. To that end, the interface can also
            be constructed to simulate a cockpit. In one variant, a user interface and control
            system similar to that used in the extant Predator and Global Hawk systems is used,
            so as to permit easy migration between operators/platforms, reduce inventory requirements,
            etc.

         <p id="p-0113" num="0112">For other potential operators, an interface that comprises a control device made to
            simulate a videogame console controller (e.g. those used with Xbox 360, PlayStation

         </p>
         <p id="p-0115" num="0114">Another important element of the CE is a display. The display shows video or other
            sensor data from “environmental” sensors located on the VSTOL apparatus, which may
            include for example electro-optic imagers (e.g., CMOS or CCD), IR imagers such as
            FLIR, electromagnetic sensors, radiation sensors (e.g., ionizing radiation such as
            neutron, beta or gamma radiation), etc. Additionally, sensors relating to the control
            of VSTOL apparatus itself (e.g., pitch, yaw, roll, airfoil angle of attack, ring RPM,
            airspeed, altitude, etc.) may feed data back to the remote CE so as to provide the
            operator information necessary to pilot the craft. This allows the remote operator
            to both control the VSTOL aircraft and react to the environment surrounding it, even
            if the operator is not in direct visual contact with the VSTOL apparatus, which is
            typically the case.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0116" num="0115">It can be appreciated that such a display could use a “heads-up” format to facilitate
            the display of sensor data and video simultaneously.

         <p id="p-0117" num="0116">In another configuration, the remote human operator could be replaced with a CE that
            further comprises a processing entity running a computer application configured to
            operate the VSTOL apparatus autonomously. Locating the processing system for VSTOL
            apparatus at a remote site has multiple advantages. First, the weight associated with
            the processing system would not encumber the VSTOL apparatus. Moreover, the processing
            system would not be exposed to the risk or harsh conditions that might be associated
            with the location of the VSTOL apparatus. Thus, the processing system and any data
            stored thereon would not be lost should the VSTOL apparatus be destroyed or become
            inoperable. Conversely, locating such processing systems remote to the apparatus introduces
            an inherent latency between the VSTOL apparatus and the processing system.

            of ordinary skill given the present disclosure.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0120" num="0125">The VSTOL can also be operated completely autonomously. In an exemplary embodiment,
            an on-board processing entity (e.g., controller 
            <b>1008</b> of figref[FIG. 10]
            	) runs a computer program configured to evaluate data supplied by on-board navigation
            equipment and sensors. The processing entity uses this data to guide the device along
            a preplanned flight path; e.g., using GPS or other fixes as “waypoints” for the flight
            path. In another variant, terrain contour data from e.g., a radio or laser altimeter
            is used and matched to a preloaded digital terrain map against which the craft registers
            to maintain its desired flight path.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0121" num="0126">It can be envisioned that the processing entity can make determinations to deviate
            from the planned flight path based on external events. For example, the apparatus
            can alter its path to continue to follow a tracked target or evade a countermeasure
            or missile. Alternatively, the apparatus can operate semi-autonomously with periodic
            command updates being sent from a remote CE or on-board computer.
         </p>
         <p id="h-0010" num="0000">Method of Operation—</p>
         <p id="p-0122" num="0127">In operation, the VSTOL apparatus generates lift by counter-rotating the rings and
            thereby allowing for continuous movement of the airfoils. Through inter alia the Bernoulli
            Principle, lift is generated.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0123" num="0128">In one embodiment, the curved shape of the airfoils provides the primary mechanism
            for lift generation. When the airfoils move through a gas, the gas flows at different
            speeds over the top and bottom of the airfoil. Specifically, the curvature is such
            that a gas moving over the top of the foil moves faster than that moving under the
            airfoil. The faster moving gas is at a lower pressure than the slower moving gas.
            This pressure imbalance leads to an upward force on the airfoil. Hence, lift is generated.
            It can also be appreciated that the leading and trailing edges of the airfoils in
            the illustrated embodiment may be shaped using a tear drop model to reduce eddy currents
            and turbulent flow as the airfoil moves through the gaseous medium.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0124" num="0129">However, to generate constant lift, the airfoil must move in the appropriate direction
            through the gaseous medium continuously. For situations in which hovering or vertical
            lift is desired, rotary motion can provide the continuous movement. However, to generate
            the torque needed to maintain the rotary motion, an equal and opposite torque must
            also be generated. As previously mentioned, conventional rotary wing aircraft use
            an orthogonally oriented rotor (e.g., tail rotor on a helicopter) to provide counter
            rotation force. However, in such aircraft the motion of the second rotor does not
            contribute to the generation of lift. Therefore, such a system would have reduced
            efficiency.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0125" num="0130">However, the VSTOL apparatus uses rings with attached airfoils that can be contra-rotated
            at the same speed such that no net torque is produced by the rings. Thus, both rotors
            contribute to lift generation and apparatus orientation stability. This increases
            the lift capability of the VSTOL apparatus and conversely its efficiency. Additionally,
            if different torques are applied to the rotors, the apparatus can be quickly and efficiently
            reoriented without a reduction in lift capacity. Notwithstanding, the VSTOL apparatus
            can be made to rotate around its central (vertical) axis by intentionally imparting
            the aforementioned torque; e.g., by rotating one ring faster than the other, adjusting
            the pitch of one ring's airfoils relative to the other, etc.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0126" num="0131">The apparatus can also be steered through the combined articulation of the upper and
            lower airfoils. Referring now to the side view shown in figref[FIG. 11]
            	, the tail of the upper airfoil is place in the fully lowered position 
            <b>1101</b>, and the tail of the lower airfoil is in the fully raised position 
            <b>1102</b>. This configuration produces “high-pitch lift.” Conversely, as shown in the side
            view of figref[FIG. 12]
            	, the tail of the upper air foil is in the raised position 
            <b>1201</b> and the tail of the lower airfoil is in the fully lowered position 
            <b>1202</b>. This configuration produces “negative lift.”
         </p>
         <p id="p-0127" num="0132">The VSTOL apparatus can generate horizontal motion by tilting its orientation with
            respect to the horizon. Thus, a portion of the force that would generate lift if the
            device were not tilted with respect to the horizon now generates horizontal motion.
            This tilting can be achieved in various ways. The apparatus can vary its center of
            mass by shifting mechanical parts or the contents of the fuselage; e.g., a normally
            centered mass can be moved, such as via electric motor, to a position off-center such
            that the aircraft will tilt downward toward that direction. In cases where the aircraft
            is powered by fossil or other fuels, the distribution of the liquid fuel can be varied
            (e.g., pumped or allowed to migrate), such as through use of a network of smaller,
            segregated fuel cells, so as to alter the weight distribution of the aircraft as desired.
            The apparatus can also vary the lift generated by the airfoils at different positions.
            This can be achieved through the use of flaps or by altering the orientation, length,
            or even shape of the airfoils as previously described.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0128" num="0133">A key advantage of the VSTOL apparatus is that is can also be operated in such that
            it utilizes air currents to generate lift. This leads to improved performance in both
            the duration that the apparatus can be deployed and the range over which it can operate.
            The disc shape of the rings and fuselage aide in overall glide and lift. Therefore,
            this VSTOL apparatus design is particularly well suited for operation based solely
            on air currents.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0129" num="0134">Lift is also generated in certain conditions by impingement of moving air against
            the upward or downward tilted airfoil exposed surface. This feature is particularly
            useful when the apparatus is in “loiter” mode, wherein the rings (and airfoils) are
            minimally rotating or not rotating, and the VSTOL apparatus is in effect acting somewhat
            like a kite. In such loiter mode, the operator (or onboard/remote computer controller)
            acts to maintain the attitude of the aircraft at a prescribed angle of attack relative
            to the prevailing winds, so as to generate sufficient lift to maintain the craft's
            altitude.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0130" num="0135">For extremely long-term operation, the motors/drive system driving the rings (and
            in some cases even articulating the airfoils) are turned off, and the VSTOL apparatus
            fully depends on air currents for lift and balance. However, with little more energy
            usage the pitch, extension, and expansion of the airfoils (as well as the position
            of aforementioned “centered” mass) can be adjusted to control the lift and balance
            of the VSTOL apparatus. This increases the flexibility of this operational mode.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0131" num="0136">Finally, the motors driving the rings can be placed in a low power consumption mode
            to further assist the ambient air currents in the generation of lift. Running the
            rotors would still lead to significant fuel consumption. However, in an adjustable
            low power consumption mode, a wide range of air current speeds can be used to assist
            in the generation of lift. In this fashion, effective use of power and fuel economy
            can be achieved.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0132" num="0137">Hovering capabilities and low turning radii allow for operation of the VSTOL apparatus
            in a crowded airspace, or one with hostile countermeasures or munitions. For example,
            operation at low altitude in an urban environment will present numerous obstacles
            (buildings and power lines etc.). To avoid these obstacles, traditional fixed wing
            aircraft would have to travel too slowly to generate sufficient lift and still negotiate
            around these obstacles. Thus, the VSTOL apparatus is well suited for surveillance
            or tracking missions through such airspace. Similarly, when over hostile territory,
            the craft can readily “viff” (a maneuver utilized by e.g., Harrier VSTOL pilots to
            rapidly slow or accelerate sideways/upwards/downwards using vectored thrust nozzles)
            so as to avoid an incoming missile, projectiles, other aircraft, etc. This can be
            accomplished by, in one variant, rapidly shifting its center of mass to the desired
            side, or alternatively rapidly changing the pitch of the airfoils on one or both rings
            so as to rapidly change altitude.
         </p>
         <p id="h-0011" num="0000">Alternate Configurations</p>
         <p id="p-0133" num="0138">Referring now to figref[FIG. 13]
            	, in another configuration, longer and narrower airfoils 
            <b>1301</b> are used in place of the shorter airfoils shown previously. The airfoils of figref[FIG. 13]
            	 are more similar to the blades seen on helicopters or wind farm generating apparatus.
            As previously noted, the number and shape of the airfoils can be changed to suit the
            requirements of specific applications. For example, applications requiring longer
            deployments of the apparatus might use longer, thinner airfoils (such as those of
            figref[FIG. 13]
            	) and/or in greater numbers to increase the power efficiency of the apparatus. This
            is similar to airfoil designs on gliders, extreme endurance aircraft, and human-powered
            airplanes, which use longer, thinner wings than powered-flight aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0134" num="0139">It will further be appreciated that the illustrated airfoils (whether in this embodiment
            or others) may include an intrinsic pitch; e.g., as a function of radial position
            or length. For instance, akin to a propeller on a conventional propeller-driven aircraft,
            the airfoils may be somewhat “twisted” or progressively curved so as to achieve desirable
            aerodynamic properties such as lift, vortex suppression, greater efficiency, etc.
            This pitch is separate from that which is imparted by actual motion (rotation) of
            the airfoil about its point of attachment as previously described herein with respect
            to, inter alia, figref[FIG. 3]
            	.

         <p id="p-0135" num="0140">Referring now to figref[FIG. 14]
            	, in some configurations, the VSTOL apparatus is powered via satellite downlink 
            <b>1401</b>. The satellite 
            <b>1402</b> provides a directed electromagnetic energy (e.g., microwave) beam, which could comprise
            a laser, maser, x-ray laser, or any other directed radiation beam, to a parabolic
            dish 
            <b>1403</b> (or other rectifying antenna) located on the VSTOL apparatus. In addition, a two-way
            communications uplink/downlink 
            <b>1404</b> could be provided on the same or another band to facilitate data transfer from the
            VSTOL device to the same or different orbital vehicle. The VSTOL apparatus may also
            include indigenous or remote dish steering capability so as to maintain the dish

         </p>
         <p id="p-0136" num="0141">It will also be appreciated that while a parabolic-type dish 
            <b>1403</b> is illustrated in the embodiment of figref[FIG. 14]
            	, appreciable amounts of electromagnetic energy may also be transferred to the craft
            via a distributed array, such as e.g., a phased array of the type well know in the
            art. In such an implementation, an array of antennas may be used to receive microwave
            band (or other) electromagnetic energy and convert the incident electricity to electrical
            power. Similar, high efficiency solar or photovoltaic cells may conceivably used,
            especially where the craft will be operating in very sunny climates (e.g., over deserts)
            and includes an energy storage means.

            <b>1503</b>, which are oriented perpendicular to the main drive wheels. The use of two sets of
            wheels increases the maximum torque that can be imparted to the rotating rings. In
            addition, the perpendicular orientation of the wheel sets helps to ensure the rings
            rotate about the optimal axis.

            	, another exemplary embodiment of the VSTOL apparatus is shown. In this embodiment,
            the wheels 
            <b>1602</b> and power rings 
            <b>1604</b> include slanted planes 
            <b>1606</b> to increase contact between the wheel and rings. The higher diameter outer portion
            of the wheel will undergo the same number of rotations 
            <b>1608</b> as the lower diameter inner portion of the wheel as it travels along the power ring.
            The slanted wheel design allows for tailored contact levels with the power ring. For
            example, in some implementations a bull nose or curved cross-section wheel makes contact
            with the power ring at a single point. For some high-torque scenarios the bull nose
            wheel ‘spins out’ rather than imparting more torque on the power ring. Thus, using
            the slant and curvature between the wheels and the power rings as a free design parameter
            allows for the friction/drag levels in to be referenced to the torque requirements
            of the system, whether statically or dynamically. As to the latter, the present disclosure
            contemplates that for instance the shape or configuration of the cross-section of
            the wheel can be altered dynamically (e.g., via internal control mechanisms), such
            that greater or lesser contact area is achieved. In low-torque situations, lesser
            contact may be desirable so as to, inter alia, maximize efficiency/mitigate frictional
            losses.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0140" num="0145">In addition, shaping (e.g. slants, grooves, curves, etc.) of the wheels and power
            rings may be used to maintain alignment between them. Referring now to figref[FIG. 17]
            	, a flat power ring exemplary embodiment 
            <b>1700</b> is shown, the alignment of the system is maintained by inline riders 
            <b>1702</b>. Tension is applied to the ring by the inline riders to maintain the alignment of
            the ring. However, the inline riders may serve as a source of drag. Because the shaped
            wheels and rings contribute to maintaining the system alignment, the reliance on the
            inline riders may be reduced. In some shaped embodiments, the total drag in the system
            is lower than that of the flat wheel system because of the reduced drag contribution
            from the inline riders. The shaped wheel/power ring pairings may include slanted planes

            <b>1604</b> and rings 
            <b>1604</b> keeps the power ring in alignment. However, the VSTOL system is no way limited to
            these slanted wheel/ring embodiments. One or more series of grooves generating a (quasi)-sinusoidal
            pattern may be used. Similarly, sawtooth or square groove patterns may be implemented.
            Further, rails may be used to provide both alignment stability and friction for the
            drive wheels. Small-scale maglev technology (e.g. rare-earth based) may also be used
            to maintain alignment on a rail or groove while providing virtually no drag component.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0141" num="0146">Referring now to figref[FIG. 19]
            	, in a further exemplary embodiment 
            <b>1900</b>, brakes 
            <b>1902</b> are added to the individual inline riders 
            <b>1702</b>. These brakes may be operated independently to generate increased drag at a specific
            location on the VSTOL apparatus. This causes the power ring rotation to slow in reference
            to the main fuselage. The overall effect is to turn the fuselage in the direction
            of rotation of the ring to which the brake was applied. For example, in a system with
            two counter rotating power rings both turning at 300 rpm, a brake is applied to the
            upper ring slowing it to 200 rpm. Via conservation of angular momentum, it is known
            that the fuselage will begin to rotate in the direction of the upper ring rotation.
            When the fuselage achieves the desired orientation, a brake may be applied to the
            lower ring slowing it to 200 rpm. This causes the fuselage to stop rotating. This
            process is shown in figref[FIG. 19]
            	
            <i>a</i>. Similarly, this turning may be achieved through driving the rings in addition to
            braking. From a 300 rpm start, the VSTOL may speed the upper ring to 35 rpm (resulting
            in a turn in the direction opposite the rotation of the upper ring) and then drive
            the bottom ring to 350 rpm to stop. Combinations of driving and braking may also allow
            turning. For example, the VSTOL may brake (drive) one ring to initiate a turn of the
            fuselage and then drive (brake) the same ring to cease turning. In some cases, constant
            rebalancing (e.g. by computer or manually) of momentum among the counter propagating
            rings may be used to maintain orientation of the fuselage. This may be applied to
