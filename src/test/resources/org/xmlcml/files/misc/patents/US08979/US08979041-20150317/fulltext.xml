<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus for supporting a tablet includes a case for receiving the tablet. A swivel includes a socket and a ball disposed and retained therein. The ball is selectively rotatable relative to the socket. The ball is coupled to the case and the socket is coupled to a mounting post. The mounting post is releasably fixed to a mounting bar. The mounting bar defines a mounting slot configured to fix the apparatus relative to a structure, such as a microphone stand or the like. The apparatus includes clamping mechanisms to enable a user to selectively fix and release the components of the apparatus such that a user can configure and fix the apparatus to a desired position for interfacing with the tablet, and then lock the apparatus in that desired position.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an apparatus for supporting a tablet. Additionally, the present disclosure relates to mounting devices generally.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A tablet computer, or simply a tablet, is a mobile computer with display, circuitry and battery in a single unit. Tablets are equipped with sensors, such as a camera, microphone, accelerometer, and touchscreen. Tablets may include physical buttons, e.g., to control basic features such as speaker volume and power and ports for network communications and to charge the battery. An on-screen, pop-up virtual keyboard may be used for typing. Tablets are typically larger than smart phones at 7 inches or larger, measured diagonally. Apple, Inc., for example, sells a popular line of tablets under the brand name iPad.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tablets are used in a variety of applications including the display of music, the provision of controls for monitoring and adjusting recording equipment or electronic instruments, the display of reading material, and the display of video, to name just a few examples. During use, the tablet is typically held in the user's hand(s) or supported on a flat surface. It is known in the art to receive a tablet in a case. Some known cases are configurable to support the tablet in different positions, for example upright on table, to facilitate use of the tablet.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As disadvantage of known cases for supporting tablets is that they do not provide a good solution for certain activities, particularly when a user must simultaneously use her hands for another task. For example, during a musical performance a guitar player may stand on a stage. A disadvantage of known cases is that they do not provide a sufficient support for the tablet because it may be too far from the performer, or in an inconvenient position.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention resides in one aspect in an apparatus for supporting a tablet. The apparatus comprises a case configured to receive a tablet, the case having a receiving plate. A swivel comprising a socket and a ball disposed and retained in the socket, the ball being rotatable relative to the socket and having a stud extending from a surface of the ball. A distal end of the stud is coupled to the receiving plate. A mounting post extends along a longitudinal axis between a first end and a second end. The first end of the mounting post is coupled to the swivel. A mounting bar extends along a longitudinal axis between a first end and a second end. The mounting bar defines an elliptical outer surface in a cross sectional plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. The mounting bar is hollow and has an inside diameter and an outside diameter. The mounting bar defines a through hole proximate to the second end. The second end of the mounting post is received in the through hole and is releasably fixed relative thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The mounting bar in the above embodiment defines a mounting slot proximate to the first end. The mounting slot comprises a bottom surface and a first radius of curvature extending from the bottom surface. The first radius of curvature has a first bearing edge defining a first elliptically enveloping surface and a second bearing edge defining a second elliptically enveloping surface. The first bearing edge and the second bearing edge converge to a leading edge. The leading edge is configured to facilitate retention of an item received in the mounting slot against the first and second bearing edges. The mounting bar further comprising a first clamping mechanism, a portion of which extends into the first end of the mounting bar towards the first radius of curvature of the mounting slot. The first clamping mechanism is configured to engage an item having an elliptical outer surface positioned in the mounting slot, thereby urging the elliptical outer surface of the item against the first radius of curvature to releasably fix the mounting bar relative to the item by urging the item against the bearing edges and the leading edge.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment of the present invention, the first clamping mechanism comprises a knob and a threaded shaft extending therefrom. The shaft is threadably engaged with the first end of the mounting bar and extends along an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the mounting bar. A distal end of the shaft extends into the mounting slot. A rotation of the knob of the first clamping mechanism relative to the mounting bar in a first direction translates the distal end of the shaft toward the first radius curvature of the mounting slot. A rotation of the knob of the first clamping mechanism relative to the mounting bar in a second direction translates the distal end of the shaft away from the first radius of curvature of the mounting slot.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment of the present invention, a push pad is coupled to a distal end of the shaft of the first clamping mechanism. The push pad defines an elliptical surface configured to engage an item received in the mounting slot.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another embodiment, an inside surface the mounting bar defines a guide slot extending along a length of the mounting bar proximate to the push pad. The push pad comprises a tab that is configured to travel in the guide slot when the push pad is translated along the longitudinal axis of the mounting bar via a rotation of the knob in the first or second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a second clamping mechanism is coupled proximate to the second end of the mounting bar. The second clamping mechanism is configured to releasably fix the mounting post relative to the mounting bar. The second clamping mechanism comprises a knob and a shaft extending therefrom, the shaft is threadably engaged with the second end of the mounting bar and extends along an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the mounting bar. A distal end of the shaft extends into the through hole. A rotation of the knob of the second clamping mechanism relative to the mounting bar in a first direction translates the distal end of the shaft into the through hole to inhibit movement of the mounting post relative to the mounting bar. A rotation of the knob of the second clamping mechanism relative to the mounting bar in a second direction translates the distal end of the shaft away from through hole to facilitate movement of the mounting post relative to the mounting bar.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a third clamping mechanism is configured to selectively fix rotation of the ball relative to the socket. The third clamping mechanism comprises a knob and a shaft extending therefrom. The shaft is threadably engaged with the socket. A rotation of the knob of the third clamping mechanism relative to the socket in a first direction translates the distal end of the shaft into the socket to inhibit rotation of the ball relative to the socket. A rotation of the knob of the third clamping mechanism relative to the socket in a second direction translates the distal end of the shaft out of the socket to facilitate rotation of the ball relative to the socket.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention resides in another aspect in an apparatus for supporting a tablet as substantially described above. In this embodiment, the mounting post is omitted and the second end of the mounting bar is coupled to the swivel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention resides in yet another aspect in a mounting bar that extends along a longitudinal axis between a first end and a second end. The mounting bar defines an elliptical outer surface in a cross sectional plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. The mounting bar is hollow and has an inside diameter and an outside diameter. The mounting bar defines a mounting slot proximate to the first end. The mounting slot comprises a bottom surface and a first radius of curvature extending from the bottom surface. The first radius of curvature has a first bearing edge defining a first elliptically enveloping surface and a second bearing edge defining a second elliptically enveloping surface. The first bearing edge and the second bearing edge converge to a leading edge. The leading edge is configured to facilitate retention of an item received in the mounting slot against the first and second bearing edges. The mounting bar further comprising a first clamping mechanism, a portion of which extends into the first end of the mounting bar towards the first radius of curvature of the mounting slot. The first clamping mechanism is configured to engage an item having an elliptical outer surface positioned in the mounting slot, thereby urging the elliptical outer surface of the item against the first radius of curvature to releasably fix the mounting bar relative to the item by urging the item against the bearing edges and the leading edge.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mounting bar <b>12</b> is coupled to the support (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the mounting post <b>14</b> is secured in the through hole <b>32</b> via threaded knobs <b>25</b> threadably engaged in threaded holes <b>39</b>. By turning the threaded knobs <b>25</b>, tips <b>25</b>A defined by shaft portions of the knobs will engage the mounting post <b>14</b> and the tubing, rods, or bars of the existing support, thereby securing the mounting bar <b>12</b> to the existing support and securing the mounting post <b>14</b> in the through hole <b>32</b>. Slots <b>30</b>, however, provide for simpler mounting as compared to through holes <b>32</b> because coupling the mounting bar <b>12</b> to the existing support can be effected without removing devices (such as microphones) to allow the existing support to be inserted through the through hole <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The present invention is not limited to the use of the threaded knob <b>25</b>, however, as other mechanisms such as toggle or spring loaded handles can also be employed without departing from the broader aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The mounting post <b>14</b> is defined by tubing sized and configured to be received in the through hole <b>32</b> of the mounting bar <b>12</b>. More specifically, the mounting post <b>14</b> is of a diameter and length that allows it to be positioned in the through hole <b>32</b> at any point along the length of the mounting post and secured in the through hole via the threaded knob <b>25</b> or other clamping mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a thread <b>44</b> is formed on a distal end of the mounting post <b>14</b> to allow the mounting post to be threadedly received in the socket <b>16</b>. The present invention is not so limited, however, as the socket <b>16</b> may be coupled to the mounting post <b>14</b> via any other suitable means. For example, the socket may be frictionally fit over the upper end of the mounting post, or the socket may be loosely fit over the upper end of the mounting post and clamped or otherwise non-rotatably fastened to the mounting post. A ball detent or quick release coupling may also be used. In the illustrated embodiment, the mounting post is a hollow tube having a cap <b>46</b> inserted into an end thereof. However, the present invention is not limited in this regard as the mounting post can also be solid, thereby obviating the need for a cap. Additionally, the mounting post is not limited to having a circular cross section, and may, for example have a rectilinear cross section. In such embodiments, it is preferred that the through hole has a rectilinear opening that corresponds to cross section of the mounting post.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the socket <b>16</b> is defined by a substantially cylindrical body portion that includes a receiving thread in a lower portion thereof for threadedly receiving the mounting post <b>14</b>. An upper portion of the socket <b>16</b> is configured to capture and retain the ball <b>48</b> (labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, a threaded knob <b>33</b> engages a threaded hole in the socket <b>16</b>. A set screw <b>37</b> is positioned in the socket <b>16</b> substantially diametrically opposite the threaded hole receiving the threaded knob <b>33</b>. A cup <b>38</b> is positioned in the socket <b>16</b>. The cup <b>38</b>, in the illustrated embodiment, has a frusto-conical shape so that as the threaded knob <b>33</b> is rotated, it pushes on the frusto-conical surface of the cup <b>38</b>, which is also resting on an end of the set screw <b>37</b>, causing it to move upward and engage a ball <b>48</b> forming the lower portion of the swivel <b>15</b>, pushing the ball against a retaining lip (shown at <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) defined by the swivel, thereby releasably fixing the swivel's position. In this manner, the swivel provides a first configuration and a second configuration. In the first configuration, the threaded knob <b>33</b> is in a released position, allowing a user of the support apparatus to rotate and angle the position of a tablet received in the case relative to the mounting bar <b>14</b>. In a second configuration, the threaded knob <b>33</b> is in an engaged position, thereby fixing the position of the ball <b>48</b> and the case <b>74</b>, and tablet <b>22</b>, relative to the end of the mounting post <b>14</b>. In this manner, a user can adjust the tablet to a desired position and, after the desired position is achieved, fix the tablet in the desired position.</p>

The slot <b>30</b>, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, comprises an end portion defined by a first radius <b>40</b>. The first radius <b>40</b> is also defined in part by a first centerline <b>41</b>. A second end portion of the slot <b>30</b> is defined by a second radius <b>42</b> defined in part by a second centerline <b>43</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second centerlines, <b>41</b> and <b>43</b> respectively, are separated by a distance designated by the reference letter &#x201c;d.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The size of the first radius <b>40</b> and the length of the distance &#x201c;d&#x201d; is dependent on the size of the mounting bar <b>12</b> as well as the size of bar, tube, or other item that the mounting bar can be attached to. In the illustrated embodiment, the first radius <b>40</b> is tangent to a bottom surface <b>51</b> defined by the slot <b>30</b>. While a second radius <b>42</b> has been described, the present invention is not limited in this regard as there can be instances where there is no second radius, but rather a substantially straight wall portion defined in part by a right angle, square corner, or other angle is without employed departing from the broader aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the illustrated embodiment, the mounting bar <b>12</b> is hollow and an end cap <b>27</b> is positioned in the body portion to accommodate a clamping mechanism. The end cap <b>27</b> defines a threaded hole <b>39</b> extending through the end cap. The clamping mechanism comprises a knob <b>25</b> that includes a threaded shaft <b>25</b>A extending outwardly therefrom. The threaded shaft <b>25</b>A is threadably engageable with the threaded hole <b>39</b> and, as will be explained in greater detail below, engages and causes the item to which the mounting bar <b>12</b> is being coupled to engage the first radius <b>40</b>. The present invention is not limited to the clamping mechanism comprising a knob <b>25</b> on a threaded shaft <b>25</b>A engageable with a threaded hole <b>39</b>, however, as other mechanisms may be employed. For example, the clamping mechanism can be a toggle clamp, ball detent, spring loaded piston, or the like. While mounting bar <b>12</b> has been described as being hollow, the present invention is not limited in this regard as the mounting bar can also be solid. In such a case, the end cap <b>27</b> would not be needed and the threaded hole <b>39</b> could be defined by the mounting bar <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the first radius <b>40</b> is defined by a leading edge <b>47</b> and two bearing edges <b>49</b>. The leading edge <b>47</b> and the two bearing edges <b>49</b> are positioned to define the slot <b>30</b> such that the center point of the slot <b>30</b> is offset from a centerline <b>53</b> extending longitudinally through the mounting bar <b>12</b> by a distance &#x201c;e&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). At least the two bearing edges <b>49</b> define elliptically enveloping surfaces that make contact with a matingly-shaped item (&#x201c;the item&#x201d;) received in the slot <b>30</b>. In offsetting the slot <b>30</b> by the distance &#x201c;e,&#x201d; a suitable amount of material remains on the body portion <b>12</b> in the area surrounding the slot to enable the item to be supported. Upon operating the clamping mechanism <b>25</b>A as shown by turning the threaded shaft <b>25</b>C to cause the translation thereof through the threaded hole <b>39</b>, the item positioned in the slot <b>14</b> is urged against the bearing edges <b>49</b> and elliptically enveloped such that the contact of the item with the bearing edges holds the item in place. The leading edge <b>47</b> further aids in releasably locking the item against the bearing edges <b>49</b>. The present invention is not limited to the center point of the slot <b>30</b> being offset from the centerline <b>53</b> as shown, however, as other configurations are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first radius <b>40</b> (and thus the leading edge <b>47</b> and the bearing edges <b>49</b>) is sized and configured to accommodate an item having a cross-sectional dimension within a specific range and up to a particular diameter. For example, a first radius <b>40</b> in a body portion <b>28</b> having a one-inch diameter may be sized and configured to receive a second member of tubing having a cross-sectional diameter of 10-16 millimeters (mm). A first radius <b>40</b> in a body portion <b>28</b> having a larger diameter may be sized and configured to receive a second member of tubing having larger cross-sectional diameter (e.g., 17-25 mm or 26-36 mm). The present invention is not limited to the configuration as shown, however, as the slot could also be squared off to attach to a tray table or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a through hole <b>32</b> extends through the body portion <b>28</b>. A clamping mechanism may be employed to secure the tubing in the through hole <b>32</b>. The clamping mechanism may be a threaded shaft translatable through an end cap or a threaded hole, as is employed to secure the tubing in the slot <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although both the slot <b>30</b> and the through hole <b>32</b> are shown as being configured to allow the tubing to be mounted therein perpendicular to the bar <b>12</b>, the present invention is not so limited as the slot and the through hole may be angled through the body portion <b>12</b> to allow the mounting bar <b>10</b> to be located on the tubing (e.g., shaft of a microphone stand or the like) at an angle.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the ball <b>48</b> of the swivel <b>15</b> is rotatably disposed in the body portion of the socket <b>16</b> and retained therein.
