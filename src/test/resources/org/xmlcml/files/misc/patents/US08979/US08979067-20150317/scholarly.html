         filed on Sep. 7, 2010, which claims the benefit of priority to Serial No. DE 10 2009
         046 202.3, filed on Oct. 30, 2009 in Germany, the disclosures of which are incorporated

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a valve insert for a valve cartridge, and to an associated
            valve cartridge for a solenoid valve, an associated solenoid valve and a method for
            producing a valve insert.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The prior art discloses solenoid valves, in particular for hydraulic units, which
            can be used, for example, in an anti-lock brake system (ABS) or a traction control
            system (TCS) or an electronic stability program system (ESP system). A solenoid valve
            as a technical component serves to monitor the inlet or outlet of gases or fluids
            or to perform open-loop or closed-loop control of the direction of flow.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">German laid-open patent application DE 10 2007 053 134 A1 describes, for example,
            a valve cartridge for a solenoid valve and an associated solenoid valve having such
            a valve cartridge. The described valve cartridge comprises a capsule, a magnet armature
            which is movably guided within the capsule, a valve insert which is inserted by a
            first end into the capsule, and a valve body which is pressed into a second end of
            the valve insert and has a main valve seat. The magnet armature which is moved by
            a magnetic force which is generated moves a plunger which is guided within the valve
            insert and which has a closing element with a seal-forming element, wherein the seal-forming
            element dips in a seal-forming fashion into the main valve seat of the valve body
            in order to carry out a sealing function. In this context, the valve insert is embodied
            as a one-piece, slotted sleeve, and the valve body is embodied as a hood-shaped sleeve.
            The valve body which is embodied as a sleeve is therefore pressed into a second end
            of the valve insert which is embodied as a slotted sleeve, in such a way that the
            main valve seat is arranged within the valve insert. The valve insert which is embodied
            as a one-piece, slotted sleeve can be produced, for example, by rolling in a sheet
            metal strip, and the valve body can be produced, for example, as a hood-shaped deep-drawn
            part. In one refinement of the valve cartridge, a later shape of an inner bore of
            the valve insert can be formed in a corresponding surface of the sheet metal strip
            before the rolling-in process. This permits any desired favorable shapes to be formed
            for a volume-equalizing groove by simply processing the corresponding surface of the
            sheet metal strip before the rolling-in process. The valve insert of the solenoid
            valve has one or more radial bores which are embodied as inflow openings and outflow
            openings. These bores have the function of permitting a specific volume flow in an
            open valve state, depending on the configuration and working point of the solenoid
            valve. The size of the bore cross section is of essential importance for the throughflow
            rate.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">The valve seat according to the disclosure for a valve cartridge of a solenoid valve
            has, in contrast, the advantage that at least one inflow opening and/or outflow opening,
            embodied as a radial bore, of the valve insert for a fluid stream is embodied with
            a trumpet-shaped geometry, in order to selectively influence the flow characteristics
            of the fluid stream. In this context, the valve insert is produced as a one-piece,
            slotted sleeve from a sheet metal strip.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">The valve insert according to the disclosure can be inserted into a valve cartridge
            or a solenoid valve in order to selectively influence the fluid flow characteristics
            in an advantageous way.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method according to the disclosure for producing a valve insert for a valve cartridge
            of a solenoid valve has, in contrast, the advantage that at least one bore is formed
            in a sheet metal strip, and at least one edge region of the at least one bore is shaped
            by a stamping process and/or cutting process as a function of a desired flow characteristic
            in such a way that, after a shaping process of the sheet metal strip to produce the
            slotted sleeve, a trumpet-shaped geometry is formed for the at least one bore.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the disclosure permit the routing of the fluid flow or the fluid flow
            behavior to be selectively influenced by producing a radial bore in the valve insert
            with a trumpet-shaped geometry which has a similarity to the shape of a Laval nozzle.
            The trumpet-shaped geometry of the radial bore can be produced, for example, by punching,
            cutting out, drilling or perforating, with stamping and/or cutting of an edge chamfer
            or edge rounded portion of the corresponding radial bore and by the subsequent shaping
            of the sheet metal strip to form the slotted sleeve by bending or rolling or the like.
            These embodiments of the disclosure can advantageously improve the quality of the
            pressure modulation and the acoustics during the execution of the assigned functions.
            In the case of a hydraulic medium, the self-venting property of the corresponding
            solenoid valve can be improved, as a result of which vibrations and noises which are
            produced by outgassing of air/gas bubbles formed during the operation can be reduced
            or eliminated. Generally, in hydraulic and pneumatic solenoid valves, the routing
            of the fluid flow can be optimized and the acoustics of the solenoid valve can be
            improved by the inventive influencing of the flow resistance and the type of flow
            as well as by producing an increase in pressure upstream of the radial bore or a pressure
            drop downstream of the radial bore. In summary, the advantages of the disclosure are
            the improved venting property, the improved vibration behavior, the improved acoustics
            of the solenoid valve and an optimized solenoid valve function as a result of the
            trumpet-shaped geometry of the inflow openings and outflow openings which are embodied
            as radial bores.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">The measures and developments which are specified in the dependent claims permit advantageous
            improvements of the valve insert specified in independent patent claim 
            <b>1</b> and of the method for producing a valve insert which is specified in independent
            patent claim 
            <b>7</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is particularly advantageous that an effective cross section of the at least one
            radial bore is tapered in the direction of the fluid stream in an inflow region up
            to a constriction and is widened in an outflow region starting from the constriction.
            The shape of the radial bore influences the flow characteristics, with the result
            that the trumpet-shaped geometry of the radial bore which is embodied as an inflow
            opening or outflow opening is approximated geometrically to the shape of a Laval nozzle.
            Owing to the improved flow routing behavior, the valve acoustics can be influenced
            positively as a result of the changing of the flow speed within the trumpet-shaped
            geometry which is produced in the radial bore which is embodied as an inflow opening
            or outflow opening.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one refinement of the valve insert according to the disclosure, a length of the
            inflow region up to the constriction is made shorter than the length of the outflow
            region starting from the constriction, in order to accelerate the fluid stream without
            severe compression shocks occurring. Alternatively, a length of the inflow region
            up to the constriction is made longer than the length of the outflow region starting
            from the constriction, in order to slow down the fluid stream. If the fluid flow is
            undesirably decelerated, the fluid flow can be braked by the compression shock and
            a decelerated pressure build-up or pressure drop can be achieved as a function of
            the application of the valve. By changing the flow speed within the radial bore which
            is embodied as an inflow opening or outflow opening it is possible to produce a partial
            vacuum in such a way that air bubbles and gas bubbles which are possibly formed in

            owing to the resulting pressure difference.

            for forming the at least one bore in the sheet metal strip are determined by a selected
            tool shape as a function of the trumpet-shaped geometry to be produced for the at
            least one bore. The at least one bore can be formed in the sheet metal strip by, for
            example, punching, perforating, cutting out or drilling, wherein, for example, a straight,
            oval, conical shape etc. can be predefined for the at least one bore through the geometry
            of the tool which is used.

         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further refinement of the method according to the disclosure, the type and/or
            parameters of the stamping process and/or cutting process are determined by a selected
            tool shape as a function of the trumpet-shaped geometry to be produced for the at
            least one bore. The stamping and/or cutting depth and/or the stamping and/or cutting
            shape can be predefined as a function of the configuration of the desired trumpet-shaped
            geometry of the at least one bore. It is therefore possible, for example, to provide
            a chamfer or a rounded portion on the bore edge regions by means of the stamping and/or
            cutting process. In this context, the sheet metal strip can be shaped both on one
            side and on both sides in the region of the bore, depending on the variant of the
            trumpet shape.

            least one bore. The shaping of the sheet metal strip to produce the slotted sleeve
            can be generated, for example, by rolling or bending over or the like.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0024" num="0023">As is apparent from figref[FIG. 1]
            	, an exemplary embodiment of a valve cartridge 
            <b>10</b> according to the disclosure for a solenoid valve comprises a capsule 
            <b>12</b>, a magnet armature 
            <b>14</b> which is movably guided within the capsule 
            <b>12</b>, a valve insert 
            <b>18</b> according to the disclosure, which is inserted by a first end into the capsule 
            <b>12</b> and is subsequently described below in detail with reference to figref[FIGS. 2 to 4]
            	, and a valve body 
            <b>19</b> with a main valve seat 
            <b>19</b>.
            <b>1</b>. A plunger 
            <b>16</b> is movably guided longitudinally within the valve insert 
            <b>18</b>, which plunger has a closing element 
            <b>16</b>.
            <b>1</b> with a sealing element 
            <b>16</b>.
            <b>2</b> which dips into the main valve seat 
            <b>19</b>.
            <b>1</b> of the valve body 
            <b>19</b> in a seal-forming fashion in order to carry out a sealing function. The plunger 
            <b>16</b> can be moved within the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> by the magnet armature 
            <b>14</b> counter to the force of a restoring spring 
            <b>17</b>, wherein the magnet armature 
            <b>14</b> is moved by a magnet force which is produced by a magnet assembly (not illustrated).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">As is also apparent from figref[FIG. 1]
            	, the capsule 
            <b>12</b> is embodied as a valve component which forms a seal with respect to the atmosphere
            and is lengthened in the direction of the caulked region 
            <b>41</b> with a fluid block 
            <b>40</b>. For this reason, the caulking forces are not taken up by the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> but rather by a caulking bush 
            <b>18</b>.
            <b>1</b>. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment of the valve cartridge according to the
            disclosure, a maximum stroke of the plunger 
            <b>16</b> can be set by axial displacement of the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> within the capsule 
            <b>12</b>. A minimum air gap 
            <b>15</b> between the magnet armature 
            <b>14</b> and the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> can be set by axial displacement of the valve body 
            <b>19</b> within the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> with an inserted armature 
            <b>14</b>. The air gap 
            <b>15</b> which is set can be defined by a crimped connection 
            <b>21</b> between the capsule 
            <b>12</b> and the valve insert 
            <b>18</b>, wherein the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> can be implemented with a circumferential groove 
            <b>18</b>.
            <b>3</b> in order to produce the crimped connection 
            <b>21</b>. As a result, the crimped connection 
            <b>21</b> ensures that the working air gap 
            <b>15</b> is maintained, wherein in addition the hydraulically acting forces can be absorbed.
            The restoring spring 
            <b>17</b> for the plunger 
            <b>16</b> is arranged outside the flow region, wherein the restoring spring 
            <b>17</b> is supported on a spring support 
            <b>23</b> which is embodied in the illustrated exemplary embodiment as a clamping sleeve which
            is introduced into the valve insert 
            <b>18</b>. Positioning the restoring spring 
            <b>17</b> out of the installation space through which there is a flow allows the wear on the
            plunger 
            <b>16</b> to be reduced and the throughflow between the main valve seat 
            <b>19</b>.
            <b>1</b> and corresponding radial bores 
            <b>18</b>.
            <b>2</b> formed in the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> to be increased.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">As is also apparent from figref[FIG. 1]
            	, the valve body 
            <b>19</b> is embodied as a hood-shaped sleeve. The valve body 
            <b>19</b> which is embodied as a sleeve is embodied, for example, as a deep-drawn part and
            is pressed via a press-in region into a second end of the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> embodied as a slotted sleeve in such a way that the main valve seat 
            <b>19</b>.
            <b>1</b> is arranged within the valve insert 
            <b>18</b>. The main valve seat 
            <b>19</b>.
            <b>1</b> in the valve body 
            <b>19</b> is decoupled from the press-in region by means of a decoupling region, in order to
            prevent the main valve seat 
            <b>19</b>.
            <b>1</b> from being deformed by the process of pressing the valve body 
            <b>19</b> into the valve insert 
            <b>18</b>. The hydraulic forces are absorbed by the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> which is implemented as a slotted sleeve. In order to prevent the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> from being widened by the pressing in of the valve body 
            <b>19</b>, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment a reinforcement ring 
            <b>22</b> is pressed onto the second end of the valve insert 
            <b>18</b>. The pressed-on reinforcement ring 
            <b>22</b> advantageously enlarges the freedom of configuration of the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> when the valve body 
            <b>19</b> is pressed in. In an alternative embodiment (not illustrated) of the valve cartridge
            
            <b>10</b> according to the disclosure, the joints of the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> which is embodied as a slotted sleeve are connected to one another at least at the
            second end of the valve insert 
            <b>18</b>, in order to increase the freedom of configuration of the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> when the valve body 
            <b>19</b> is pressed in. The joints of the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> which is embodied as a slotted sleeve can be connected to one another, for example,
            by welding and/or bonding and/or interlocking.

         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">As is also apparent from figref[FIG. 1]
            	, a valve lower part 
            <b>20</b> which is embodied as a plastic insert is positioned and supported axially on the
            valve insert 
            <b>18</b>, wherein the valve lower part 
            <b>20</b> is inserted in a seal-forming fashion into an interior space of the valve body 
            <b>19</b> via a dome and is sealed with the outer contour with respect to the surrounding fluid
            block 
            <b>40</b>. In addition, the illustrated valve lower part 
            <b>20</b> comprises an eccentrically arranged non-return valve 
            <b>20</b>.
            <b>1</b> which carries out a direction-oriented through-flow function. In addition, the valve
            lower part 
            <b>20</b> accommodates a flat filter

            	, the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> is embodied as a one-piece slotted sleeve which comprises three radial bores 
            <b>18</b>.
            <b>2</b> which are arranged symmetrically along the circumference and located transversely
            with respect to the valve insert

            <b>18</b>.
            <b>4</b> as an inflow opening. The radial bores 
            <b>18</b>.
            <b>2</b> have the function that, in an opened valve state, they permit a specific fluid volume
            flow 
            <b>42</b> to pass through as a function of the configuration and the working point of the solenoid
            valve. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the inner bore 
            <b>18</b>.
            <b>4</b> of the valve insert 
            <b>18</b> has a virtually perfect or very closely approximated circular shape in which the
            plunger 
            <b>16</b> is guided. In the opened solenoid valve state, the fluid flow 
            <b>42</b> flows through the main valve seat 
            <b>19</b>.
            <b>1</b> and the outflow openings which are embodied as radial bores 
            <b>18</b>.
            <b>2</b>. In this context, the shape of the radial bores 
            <b>18</b>.
            <b>2</b> influences the flow characteristics. According to the invention, the radial bores
            
            <b>18</b>.
            <b>2</b> are each formed with a trumpet-shaped geometry, in order to selectively influence
            the flow characteristics of the fluid stream
