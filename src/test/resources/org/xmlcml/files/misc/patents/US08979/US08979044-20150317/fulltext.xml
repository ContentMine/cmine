<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention provides compositions and methods for holding systems, devices, apparatuses, or portions thereof in a retracted, extended, or intermediate configuration. In particular, the invention provides permanent magnets and/or magnetizable materials configured to hold systems, devices, apparatuses, or portions thereof in retracted, extended, and/or intermediate configurations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A variety of installed lighting applications involve lights which are extendable and retractable. Lighting may be installed in furniture, seating, seating arrangements, cars, boats, medical equipment, etc. Various mechanical mechanisms exist for positioning lights at various degrees of extension (e.g., springs, friction elements, locking assemblies, etc.). Unfortunately, these mechanisms can be cumbersome, and due to their reliance on mechanical devices, they wear out or become non-functional over time. Further, mechanical hold devices tend to be limited in the number, or variety of positions in which they can hold an extendable light.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention provides compositions and methods for holding systems, devices, apparatuses, or portions thereof in a retracted, extended, or intermediate configuration. In particular, the invention provides permanent magnets and/or magnetizable materials configured to hold systems, devices, apparatuses, or portions thereof in retracted, extended, and/or intermediate configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, the invention provides an apparatus comprising: (a) a housing, wherein the housing comprises one or more permanent magnets; (b) a support element, wherein the support element has an elongate shape comprising proximal and distal ends, wherein the support element is capable of extending from and retracting into or through the housing, and wherein the support element comprises a ferromagnetic material; and (c) a functional element connected to the distal end of the support element; wherein upon alignment of the ferromagnetic material of the support element with the one or more permanent magnets of the housing, the support element is held at a fixed degree of extendedness from the housing. The invention is not limited by the orientation of the proximate and distal ends of the support element. For example, in some embodiments, the proximate and distal ends are relative to the functional element (e.g., the proximate end is the end of the support element that is closest to the functional element whereas the distal end is the end that is furthest from the functional element). In some embodiments, the proximate and distal ends are relative to the housing (e.g., the proximate end is the end of the support element that is closest to the housing (e.g., when the support element is fully extended from and/or through the housing) whereas the distal end is the end that is furthest from the housing (e.g., when the support element is fully extended from and/or through the housing)). In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic material comprises a magnetizable material. In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic and/or magnetizable material is located at discrete locations (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 . . . 20 . . . 50, or more locations) along the length of the support element. In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic and/or magnetizable material is continuous along the length of the support element. In some embodiments, the support element is comprised of the ferromagnetic and/or magnetizable material. The invention is not limited by the type of functional element that is part of the apparatus. Indeed, a variety of functional elements may be used including, but not limited to, a light or light fixture (e.g., reading light), air freshener, speaker, microphone, mirror, device holder (e.g., phone holder, IPOD holder, IPAD holder, MP3 player holder, etc.), remote control, picture frame, drink holder, book holder, fan holder, notepad holder, etc. In some embodiments, the support element comprises an electrical connection between the functional element and a power source. In some embodiments, the housing comprises a free-standing base. In some embodiments, the housing is configured for mounting on and/or in an object (e.g., for mounting the apparatus on and/or in an object). The invention is not limited by the type of object to which the housing and/or apparatus can be mounted on and/or within. The housing and/or apparatus can be mounted to a variety of objects including, but not limited to, furniture, theater seating, conference seating, a wheelchair, a desk, a hospital bed, a wall, a car (e.g., a console or other part of the car), an ambulance, an ambulance cot, a boat, a plane, a train, medical equipment or other object. In some embodiments, the housing is configured for mounting the apparatus into the arm rest, back rest, side, top, or console of a seating element. A variety of seating elements may be used including, but not limited to, a lounge chair, theater seating, a vehicle seat, a hospital bed, wheelchair, ambulance or ambulance cot, a couch or other object used as a seat. In some embodiments, fully retracting the support element into or through the housing places the functional element within or adjacent to the housing. In some embodiments, the support element comprises one or more permanent magnets at one of its ends wherein the one or more permanent magnets interact with the housing (e.g., with the one or more permanent magnets residing within the housing) to hold the support element in either a fully retracted or fully extended configuration. In some embodiments, the support element comprises one or more permanent magnets between the proximal end and the distal end that interact with the one or more housing magnets to hold the support element in discrete partially extended or retracted configuration (e.g., wherein moving the support element from the partially extended or retracted configuration requires more force (e.g., due to the magnet-magnet interaction) to move to a more extended or retracted position than in the absence of the one or more permanent magnets between the proximal end and the distal end. In some embodiments, the support element is flexible, bendable, rotatable, or a combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the force resulting from alignment of the permanent magnets of the housing with the magnetizable material of the support element is sufficient to resist the pull of gravity on the support element and the functional element. In further preferred embodiment, the force is sufficient to resist forces caused by minor disturbances. In some embodiments, the magnetic interaction is easily overcome by a user of low to average strength. In some embodiments, the magnetic interaction is overcome by a force of 5-100 newtons applied to the support element. The invention is not limited by the amount of force that is required to move the support element (e.g., into, out of, or through the housing). For example, permanent magnets of a selected strength and/or a select ferromagnetic material for the support element may be used that create the desired strength of interaction between the magnet(s) and support element that in turn define the amount of force required to move the support element (e.g., into, out of, or through the housing). Thus, the force may be less than 5 newtons or greater than 100 newtons depending on the material and/or magnets chosen. In some embodiments, upon alignment of the ferromagnetic material of the support element with the one or more housing magnets, the support element is held at a fixed degree of extendedness from the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the invention provides an apparatus comprising: (a) a housing comprising one or more housing magnets; (b) a support element, wherein the support element has an elongate shape comprising proximal and distal ends, wherein the support element is capable of extending from and retracting into the housing, and wherein the support element comprises one or more support-element magnets along the length of the support element; and (c) a functional element connected to the distal end of the support element; wherein, upon alignment of one of the support-element magnets with the one or more housing magnets, the support element is held at a fixed degree of extendedness from the housing. The invention is not limited by the type of functional element connected to the support element. Indeed, a variety of functional elements may be part of the apparatus including, but not limited to, a light or light fixture (e.g., reading light), air freshener, speaker, microphone, mirror, device holder (e.g., phone holder, IPOD holder, IPAD holder, MP3 player holder, etc.), remote control, picture frame, drink holder, book holder, fan holder, notepad holder, etc. In some embodiments, the functional element is a light-emitting element. In some embodiments, the support element further comprises an electrical connection between the functional element and a power source. In some embodiments, the housing comprises a free-standing base. In some embodiments, the housing is configured for mounting the apparatus on and/or in an object. The invention is not limited by the nature of the object. Indeed, any object onto which and/or into which a housing can be mounted may be used, including, but not limited to, furniture, seating or seating arrangement, console (e.g., center console in a vehicle), a wall, a vehicle, or medical equipment. In some embodiments, the housing is configured for mounting the apparatus into the arm rest, back rest, side, top, or console of a seating element. In some embodiments, the seating element is selected from a lounge chair, theater seating, a vehicle seat, a hospital bed, wheelchair or other patient transport device (e.g., ambulance cot), or a couch. In some embodiments, fully retracting the support element into the housing places the functional element within or adjacent to the housing. In some embodiments, the support element comprises one or more magnets on or adjacent to the distal end that are capable of interacting with the one or more housing magnets to hold the support element in a fully retracted configuration. In some embodiments, the support element comprises one or more magnets at or adjacent to the proximal end that are capable of interacting with the housing magnets to hold the support element in a fully extended configuration. In some embodiments, the support element comprises one or more magnets between the proximal end and the distal end that are capable of interacting with the housing magnets to hold the support element in any position including fully retracted, fully extended, or any degree of extension/retraction there between. In some embodiments, the support element comprises magnets between the proximal end and the distal end that are capable of interacting with the housing magnets to hold the support element in any position. The invention is not limited by the number of magnets between the proximal and distal ends. Indeed, any number of magnets can be used depending upon the apparatus and uses thereof, including but not limited to: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, or more magnets. In some embodiments, the support element further comprises one or more support-element magnets near the proximal end and one or more support-element magnets near the distal end. In some embodiments, the support element is flexible, bendable, rotatable, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, upon alignment of one of the support-element magnets with the one or more housing magnets the resulting magnetic interaction is sufficient to resist the pull of gravity on the support element and the functional element (e.g., thereby holding the support element at a fixed degree of extension/retraction). In some embodiments, the magnetic interaction is further sufficient to resist forces caused by minor disturbances (e.g., inadvertent jostling, motion of a car, etc.). In some embodiments, the degree of magnetic interaction is configured (e.g., using magnets of a certain strength and/or using a specific number of magnets) such that the magnetic interaction is easily overcome by a user of low to average strength (e.g., child, elderly person, healthy person). For example, in some embodiments, the magnetic interaction is overcome by a force of about 5-100 newtons applied to the support element, although the apparatus can be configured to be alterable (e.g., movable) with smaller or larger amounts of force. In some embodiments, the magnetic interaction is overcome by a force of 10-40 newtons applied to the support element.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention provides compositions and methods for holding systems, devices, apparatuses, or portions thereof in a retracted, extended, or intermediate configuration. In particular, the invention provides magnets configured to hold installed lighting in retracted, extended, and/or intermediate configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the invention provides an apparatus (e.g., light fixture or other non-lighting device or apparatus) comprising one or more shafts, necks, and/or support elements. The apparatus is extendable/retractable, raised/lowered, or in some way adjusted, repositioned, and/or configured by extending and retracting one or more support elements. As described herein, support elements are elongate members with a distal end, proximal end, and intermediate region. In some embodiments, support elements are attached to an apparatus, device, and/or functional element on one end (e.g., distal end). In some embodiments, support elements are configured to retract into and/or through, and/or extend from, a base or housing. In some embodiments, the distal end of a support element is within, or adjacent to, the housing when the support element is fully retracted. In some embodiments, the proximal end of a support element is within, or adjacent to, the housing (e.g. within or adjacent to the opening of the housing) when the support element is fully extended. In some embodiments, the intermediate region of a support element is within, or adjacent to, the housing (e.g. within or adjacent to the opening of the housing) when the support element is partially extended or in an intermediate configuration (e.g., partially extended).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, a housing comprises one or more permanent magnets located within the housing (e.g., housing magnets), or adjacent to the opening through which a support element passes. In some embodiments, the one or more support elements each comprise ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) positioned along its/their length(s) (e.g., located at discrete positions or continuously along the length of the support element). In some embodiments, interaction between the housing magnets and the ferromagnetic material of the support-element (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) holds the apparatus at a fixed degree of extendedness (e.g., fully extended, fully retracted, intermediate extendedness), fixed height, fixed position, etc. In some embodiments, as the apparatus is extended or raised, the attractive force between the ferromagnetic material of the support-element (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) and housing magnet(s) hold the apparatus in a defined (e.g., user defined) position, height, configuration, or degree of extendedness. In some embodiments, the attractive force between the ferromagnetic material of the support-element (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) and housing magnet(s) prevent the support element(s) from sliding back into the housing(s) (or to a fully extended position) upon being placed in a partially extended position (e.g., by a user). In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic material of the support-element is installed within or along the support element(s) at predetermined intervals. In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic material of the support-element (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is placed at desired positions along or within the support element(s). In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic material of the support-element (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is repositional along the support-element(s) to adjust the hold-positions (e.g., degree of extendedness) of the apparatus. In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic material of the support-element is continuous throughout the length of the support element(s). In some embodiments, a support element is constructed of a ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides an apparatus comprising a light, light fixture, and/or light-emitting device as the functional element. In some embodiments, a light fixture comprises a shaft (e.g., flexible shaft) which is retractable into a housing. In some embodiments, the housing is a base, configured to support the light fixture. In some embodiments, a housing is a stand-alone base. In some embodiments, a housing is configured for mounting on, or installation within, an object or apparatus (e.g., seating, wall, furniture, vehicle, hospital bed, etc.). In some embodiments, the shaft of the apparatus comprises a continuous ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material) along its length. In some embodiments, the shaft of the apparatus comprises ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) positioned at discrete positions along its length. In some embodiments, the housing comprises one or more magnets located within the housing, or adjacent to the opening in the housing through which the shaft passes. In some embodiments, interaction between the housing magnets and the ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) of the shaft holds the light at a fixed degree of extendedness (e.g., fully extended, fully retracted, a certain degree of extendedness). In some embodiments, as the light is extended, the attractive force between the ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) of the shaft and the housing magnet(s) hold the light in a defined (e.g., user defined) position, configuration, or degree of extendedness. In some embodiments, the attractive force between the ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) of the shaft and housing magnet(s) prevent the light from sliding back into its housing (or to a fully extended position) upon being placed in a partially extended position (e.g., by a user). In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) of the shaft is installed, attached, mounted, integrated, and/or operably connected within or along the shaft (e.g., continuously or at predetermined intervals). In some embodiments, ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is placed at desired positions along or within the shaft. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is repositioned along the shaft to adjust the hold-positions of the light fixture. The light, light fixture, and/or light-emitting device is therefore setable at any degree of extendedness in which the ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) of the support element is aligned with a housing magnet. For example, in some embodiments the locations of ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) along the support elements are adjustable such that the position(s) at which an apparatus is maintained is adjustable. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is widely spaced along a support element (e.g., several (e.g., 2 or 3, or more) locations along the length of a support element; spaced 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 inches apart; spaced every foot along a support element), providing relatively few hold positions. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is tightly spaced along a support element (e.g., multiple (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more locations spaced every 0.1 inches, 0.2 inches, 0.5 inches, 1 inch, etc. along the length of a support element), providing many hold positions, and a higher degree of control of extendedness. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is uniformly spaced along a support element. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material, permanent magnets, etc.) is non-uniformly spaced along a support element (e.g., user-defined positions, ergonomically-determined positions).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, a support element comprises a ferromagnetic material (e.g., magnetizable material) continuously along the length of the support element. In some embodiment, the support element comprises a magnetizable material from its proximal end to its distal end. In some embodiments, a support element is constructed partially or entirely of a magnetizable material (e.g. iron, copper, nickel, steel, etc.). In some embodiments, a support element is constructed partially or entirely of one or more magnetizable materials (e.g. iron, copper, nickel, steel, etc.). In some embodiments, a support element or shaft is metallic, a magnet, or a magnetizable metal. In some embodiments, the inner core of a support element comprises a magnetizable material. In some embodiments, a support element is coated with a non-magnetizable material (e.g., rubber, plastic, polymer, leather, metal, etc.). In some embodiments, a support element comprises one or more magnetizable materials (e.g., continuously along the length of the support element) and one or more non-magnetizable materials.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, because the support element comprises magnetizable material continuously along its length, the housing magnets will hold the support element at any degree of extendedness. In some embodiments, because the support element comprises magnetizable material continuously along its length, the magnetizable material of the support element is always aligned with the housing magnets. In some embodiments, the presence of magnetizable material along the entire length of the support element provides infinite control of the degree of extendedness of the support element and supported device or apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention is not limited to a light, light fixture, and/or light-emitting device as the functional element. Indeed, any apparatus, device, or portion thereof may be used as a functional element. For example, in some embodiments, the functional element is any one or more of a variety of devices and apparatuses, including, but not limited to: device holders (e.g., cup holders, miniature fan, phone holder, remote control holder, mirror (e.g., makeup mirror, rear-view mirror), dental tools, surgical tools, orthopedic traction, and/or any device, apparatus, or portion thereof which benefits from (or would benefit from) being stably held in a position or at a certain degree of extendedness (e.g., a light (e.g., a reading light), air freshener, speaker(s), microphone, mirror, device holder (e.g., PDA, mp3 player (e.g., IPOD), IPAD), remote control, picture frame, note pad, drink holder, book holder, fan, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the invention provides an adjustable (e.g., height adjustable), concealable (e.g. within a housing or base), and/or retractable device or apparatus (e.g., light fixture). In some embodiments, the device (e.g. light fixture) is installed, mounted, connected, attached, and/or configured to an object (e.g. piece of furniture (e.g. chair), wall, hospital bed, vehicle, seating, etc.), apparatus, or element. In some embodiments, a device is installed in furniture (e.g. chair, desk, bed, book case, dresser, etc), seating arrangements (e.g. theater seating, conference seating, etc.), medical equipment (e.g., hospital bed, ambulance, medical cart, etc.) and/or a vehicle (e.g. car, truck, boat, plane, train, etc.). In some embodiments, when installed and/or mounted in/on a chair, couch, or other form of seating, a light (or other device) is mounted on the arm rest, head rest, side of chair, console area between seats, etc. In some embodiments, when installed and/or mounted in/on vehicle (e.g. car, truck, boat, plane, train, etc.), a light (or other apparatus) is mounted on the dashboard, overhead, on a console, on a door, on an armrest, along the seat back, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Magnets employed in the present invention (e.g., as housing magnets, support-element magnets, end-stop magnets, etc.) are not limited as to size, shape, and/or magnetic field strength. Indeed, in some embodiments, magnets are of any suitable shape, including but not limited to: cylinder, cube, rectangular, flat, ovular, oblong, elongate, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, magnets have dimensions (e.g., height width, length, diameter, etc.) between 1 mm and 1 m (e.g., a cylinder with diameter of 5 mm and height of 5 mm; a cube of 1 cm on a side; and elongate cylinder with a diameter of 4 mm and a length of 500 cm; a flat disc of 1 cm diameter and 1 mm height; a 1 cm by 5 mm by 5 mm box; etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, a device (e.g. light) mounted in/on an object is configured to adopt multiple conformations, for example: concealed and exposed, stowed and deployed, retracted and extended, low and high, concealed and revealed, and intermediate conformations therein. In some embodiments, a device or apparatus is configured to adopt multiple intermediate conformations (e.g. partially extended). In some embodiments, a device or apparatus (e.g. light) is configured to adopt discrete intermediate positions. In some embodiments, a device (e.g. light) is configured to adopt any position between fully extended and fully retracted. In some embodiments, a device or apparatus is held in place at discrete positions (e.g., fully extended, fully retracted, intermediate positions) by the interaction between housing magnets and ferromagnetic material of the support-element. In some embodiments, a device or apparatus is prevented from slipping or dislodging from a desired or discrete position (e.g., height) by the interaction between housing magnets and ferromagnetic material of the support-element.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, a support element is capable of rotating, bending, flexing, turning, swiveling, etc. along all or a portion of its length. In some embodiments, the present invention holds a support element at the same height or degree of extendedness, while allowing the support element to be rotated, bent, flexed, turned, swiveled, etc. In some embodiments, a user is able to maintain the degree of extendedness of a support element while otherwise adjusting the position of an apparatus or device supported by the support element.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, a housing comprises one or more housing magnets (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more). In some embodiments, multiple housing magnets are configured to interact with a single appropriately positioned support-element magnet. In some embodiments, multiple housing magnets are configured to simultaneously interact with multiple appropriately positioned support-element magnets. In some embodiments, two or more housing magnets are of the same or different magnetic field strengths.
