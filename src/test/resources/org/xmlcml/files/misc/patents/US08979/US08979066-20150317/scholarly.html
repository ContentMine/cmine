      <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
      <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">Conventional structural designs of solenoid valves have several disadvantages from
            a production engineering viewpoint. In particular, the structural designs comprise
            a great number of individual parts/assemblies, for which great assembly lines with
            circulating work carriers are required for assembly or production. This generally
            requires the following operations: loading the work carriers with the various individual
            parts and subassemblies, adjusting and laser welding components of the magnetic circuit,
            and screwing, riveting, flanging the magnetic circuit with the valve housing.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">One disadvantage of the described production of the conventionally designed solenoid
            valves is particularly that of the large and technically complex assembly lines required
            for this. Adjustments and laser weldings of the components of the magnetic circuit
            are technically complex and resource-intensive. The individual assembly steps each
            need a screwing, riveting, bending, flanging and welding device of their own, whereby
            the numerous assembly steps have the cumulative effect of causing many tolerances,
            which may lead to a significant overall tolerance, and consequently inaccuracy of
            the solenoid valve.

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a solenoid valve that
            is simpler to produce.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">The object is achieved by a solenoid valve with a substantially circular cross-sectional
            shape orthogonally in relation to an effective axis of the solenoid valve, it being
            possible for valve devices of the solenoid valve to be connected to one another by
            means of joining operations directed substantially in the direction of the effective
            axis, the valve devices having such peripheral shapes that the valve devices can be

         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">One advantage of the solenoid valve according to the invention is that the solenoid
            valve can be assembled from valve devices by means of simple axial joining operations,
            the valve devices being automatically centered and positioned with respect to one
            another during the joining operations on account of their specific shapings. This
            advantageously results in little assembly effort, which saves time and may have as
            a consequence significant cost reductions in comparison with conventional solenoid
            valves.

         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">A preferred embodiment of the solenoid valve according to the invention provides that
            a first valve device is formed as a lifting magnet, the lifting magnet having a lifting
            rod as a centering means for centering elements that can be arranged in series on
            the lifting rod. With the aid of the centering means in the form of the lifting rod,
            onto which the elements of the lifting magnet can as it were be threaded, a first
            valve device in the form of the lifting magnet can be preassembled simply and exactly.

         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further preferred embodiment of the solenoid valve according to the invention provides
            that the lifting magnet has a fixing element for the mechanical fixing of the elements
            arranged in series on the lifting rod. In this way, a simple fixing element is used
            for the mechanical fixing of the elements arranged in series on the lifting rod, which
            facilitates and speeds up an assembly operation of the lifting magnet subassembly.

            for the magnet coil, it is consequently advantageously possible in a simple way to

            means in the second valve device is that the joining together of the first valve device
            with the second valve device is simplified insofar as an automatic centering of the
            first valve device is carried out by said centering means during the joining operation
            of the first valve device with the second valve device.

            connector device consequently allows an assembly step of assembling the connector
            in the second valve device to be carried out in a simplified and speeded-up way, since

            	 shows a first valve device 
            <b>10</b> of an embodiment of the solenoid valve according to the invention in an exploded
            view. The first valve device 
            <b>10</b> has a lifting rod 
            <b>11</b>, which preferably comprises a material that is produced by means of a multi-component
            injection-molding process. The multi-component injection-molding process is preferably
            a two-component injection-molding technique, which allows the lifting rod 
            <b>11</b> to be produced in a simple way and a sealing element 
            <b>11</b>
            <i>a </i>to be molded onto a sealing end of the lifting rod 
            <b>11</b> in a single production step. Individual elements of the first valve device 
            <b>10</b>, which in the assembled-together state embody a lifting magnet, are fitted or threaded
            one after the other onto the lifting rod 
            <b>11</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">The individual elements comprise a seal 
            <b>12</b>, which is preferably formed as a sealing ring with a dirt wiper. A circular connection

            <b>13</b>
            <i>a </i>with a guiding bush 
            <b>13</b> pressed into the connection plate 
            <b>13</b>
            <i>a </i>is also fitted onto the lifting rod 
            <b>11</b>. After that, a first O-ring 
            <b>14</b>, which is used for sealing purposes within the first valve device 
            <b>10</b>, is pushed onto the lifting rod 
            <b>11</b>. Then, a spring 
            <b>15</b>, which serves for unlocking the solenoid valve in the deenergized state, is arranged
            in series on the lifting rod 
            <b>11</b>. The lifting rod 
            <b>11</b> is finally inserted through a magnet armature 
            <b>16</b> similar to a circular cylinder and is mechanically fixed by means of a clamping disk
            
            <b>17</b> with blocking elements (not represented) that is preferably produced from bronze
            or steel, resulting in a complete subassembly in the form of a lifting magnet with
            substantially circular peripheral shapes, a circle centerpoint corresponding to an
            effective axis of the solenoid valve.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is therefore evident that the lifting rod 
            <b>11</b> serves as a centering element similar to a circular cylinder, which receives the
            elements

         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">figref[FIG. 2]
            	 shows in elevation a sectional view of a second valve device 
            <b>20</b>, which in the assembled-together state serves as a housing for the lifting magnet
            of the first valve device 
            <b>10</b>. The second valve device 
            <b>20</b> is formed like a circular cylinder that is open on one side, a centering device in
            the form of a magnetic return ring 
            <b>21</b> being provided at a closed end. The return ring 
            <b>21</b>, as part of a ferromagnetic circuit of the solenoid valve, is intended also to serve
            as a guiding and centering element for the lifting magnet. For this purpose, the return
            ring 
            <b>21</b> is formed as a tubular piece integrally with the second valve device 
            <b>20</b>. At an upper, open portion of the second valve device 
            <b>20</b>, the second valve device 
            <b>20</b> has three first clearances 
            <b>23</b>, intended as coding elements for the insertion of the connection plate 
            <b>13</b>
            <i>a </i>of the lifting magnet.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second valve device 
            <b>20</b> also has at the upper open end a second clearance 
            <b>25</b>, which is intended as an assembly location and a coding element for a connector 
            <b>24</b>, which supplies energy to a fully encapsulated magnet coil 
            <b>22</b>. This helps in a simple way to allow the connector 
            <b>24</b> to be inserted into the second valve device 
            <b>20</b> only at a position intended for it. Alternatively, the second clearance 
            <b>25</b> may be arranged at a position (not represented) in the second valve device 
            <b>20</b> that is offset by 120°, so that an alternative positioning of the connector 
            <b>24</b> is possible. Misplacements of the connector 
            <b>24</b> are in this way advantageously ruled out. The second valve device 
            <b>20</b> also has at its upper, open end retaining elements 
            <b>26</b>, which are used for a positioning and fastening of the second valve device 
            <b>20</b> in a third valve device 
            <b>30</b> (not shown in figref[FIG. 2]
            	). The retaining elements 
            <b>26</b> are in this case preferably formed as undercuts of the second valve device 
            <b>20</b>. It is evident from figref[FIG. 2]
            	 that the solenoid valve 
            <b>22</b> with the connector 
            <b>24</b> can be pushed in the axial direction of the solenoid valve into the second valve
            device 
            <b>20</b> axially from above.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0032" num="0031">figref[FIG. 3]
            	 shows the two preassembled valve devices 
            <b>10</b>, 
            <b>20</b> in a cross-sectional view in elevation. The individual elements of the valve devices
            
            <b>10</b>, 
            <b>20</b> have already been explained in more detail with reference to figref[FIGS. 1 and 2]
            	 and are therefore not explained again here. It is evident that then, in a next production
            step, the first valve device 
            <b>10</b> is pushed into the second valve device 
            <b>20</b> from above along an effective axis of the solenoid valve by means of an axial joining
            operation. The circular inner circumference of the second valve device 
            <b>20</b> thereby acts as a guide for an outer rim of the circular connection plate 
            <b>13</b> of the first valve device 
            <b>10</b>. The first clearances 
            <b>23</b> at the upper open end of the second valve device 
            <b>20</b> are intended for interacting with radially formed portions of the circular connection

            <i>a </i>in such a way that said portions engage in the first clearances 
            <b>23</b> and in this way accomplish efficient antitwist protection between the first valve
            device 
            <b>10</b> and the second valve device 
            <b>20</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is evident that the return ring 
            <b>21</b> of the second valve device

            <b>16</b> of the first valve device 
            <b>10</b>. The first valve device 
            <b>10</b> is in this way centered and positioned at an end opposite from the sealing portion
            by means of the magnet armature 
            <b>16</b> and the return ring 
            <b>21</b> adapted to the magnet armature

            <b>13</b> of the first valve device 
            <b>10</b>. It is therefore evident that an automatic positioning or centering of the first
            valve device 
            <b>10</b> within the second valve device 
            <b>20</b> is facilitated particularly also because of the radial peripheral shapes of elements
            of the first and second valve devices 
            <b>10</b>, 
            <b>20</b>.

            which has an inflow and an outflow for a fluid to be transported by the solenoid valve.
            In an effective axis of the solenoid valve that is oriented in the direction of the

            device

            <b>30</b>, the second valve device 
            <b>20</b> is turned by a few angular degrees (preferably by approximately 5° to approximately
            10°) with respect to the third valve device

         <p id="p-0040" num="0039">To sum up, a solenoid valve which can be preassembled and finally assembled in a simple
            way is proposed, individual valve devices being able to be connected to one another
            in a final assembly process by means of axial joining operations. Shapings of the
            valve devices that are adapted to one another and positioning or centering elements
            arranged in the valve devices serve the purpose of allowing the valve devices to be
            positioned or centered exactly in relation to one another on the basis of the joining
            operations. The ease with which they can be centered is attributable not least to
            the fact that the valve devices have substantially circular peripheral shapes that
            are adapted to one another, a common circle centerpoint corresponding to the effective
            axis of the solenoid valve.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0041" num="0040">This advantageously dispenses with the need for any additional centering and/or adjusting
            effort with corresponding auxiliary processes, which can significantly speed up a
            production process of the solenoid valve according to the invention and thereby considerably
            reduce the costs. Particularly advantageously, the complete production process of
            the solenoid valve can be carried out at a single assembly site. There is advantageously
            no need for complex laser-welded, flanged, riveted or screwed connections of individual
            valve groups, advantageously resulting in a favorable overall tolerance as the cumulative
            effect of few tolerances. As a result, a solenoid valve that can be efficiently produced
            with few resources, and therefore economically, is provided by the invention.

         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is self-evident to a person skilled in the art that the described features of the
            invention can be suitably modified and combined with one another without departing
            from the essence of the invention.
