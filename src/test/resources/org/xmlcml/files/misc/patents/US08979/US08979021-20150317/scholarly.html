         <h1>TECHNICAL FIELD</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The exemplary hydraulic air bleed valve system relates to an air bleed valve that
            is activated based on signals from an acoustic wave sensor(s).
         </p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Air bleed valves are used in aircraft hydraulic systems to remove unwanted air from
            the hydraulic circuit prior to the operation of the high pressure hydraulic system
            to prevent unexpected and unwanted operational anomalies. Due to certain flight regimes,
            a traditional air bleed valve cannot be used in certain high performance aircraft,
            primarily those aircraft used in military applications. High G loads and inverted
            flight modes do not allow the air in the hydraulic system to be bled when experiencing
            these flight regimes. Therefore it is necessary to use sensors to determine when there
            is air in the hydraulic system and then electronically open an air vent valve to discharge
            the air when the aircraft is flying in a suitable flight mode. Traditional air bleed
            valves are usually bled when the pilot manually triggers the vent valve circuit. Sensors
            can be used in the air bleed valve such as a light emitting diode and a photoelectric
            diode to indicate that there is air in the hydraulic system and then send a signal
            to the pilot that the air vent in the air bleed valve needs to be activated. Pub.
            No. US 2010/0319791 A1 to Dirkin et al. disclose such a system. In the Dirkin system
            two LEDs and a phototransistor and three transparent windows are used to sense the
            presence of air. When air is detected by an electronic circuit which is connected
            to the phototransistor and the LEDs, a signal is sent to the flight deck so that the
            vent valve can be activated. This system is subject to several operational limitations
            involving clouding of the windows and failure of the phototransistor.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Other bleed air systems known in the art include those shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,524,793
            and 4,813,446 to Silverwater et al. These prior art devices provide for the automatic
            bleeding of air at the time of hydraulic pump start up only using differential pressure
            between the air and the hydraulic oil to move a piston to control the bleeding process.
            This system is self activating and is not controlled by the flight crew or an electronic
            control system so the air is automatically vented whenever it is present irrespective
            of the aircraft flight mode. This presents a problem in high performance aircraft
            since the air cannot be vented in certain flight regimes. Also, this type of air bleed
            valve is not as reliable or dependable as what is needed in the industry for use in
            high performance aircraft.

         <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">The exemplary electronically controlled air bleed valve system provides for a robust
            solution for bleeding air from a hydraulic system whenever the level of air in a plenum
            exceeds a set level that is measured with the use of one or more acoustic wave sensors.
            One sensor can be located to set the characteristic wave propagation transfer function
            when submerged in oil while a second sensor can be located at the minimum allowable
            level of air allowed within the hydraulic plenum. An electronic control system processes
            the signals generated by the acoustic wave sensors and uses these to determine if
            the vent valve should be opened to allow the air to be bled from the hydraulic system.
            The vent valve can be a solenoid valve or a MEMs type valve or other type of vent
            valve mechanism which can be activated quickly and with a relatively low electrical
            power requirement.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of acoustic wave sensors in an aircraft air bleed valve is new and offers
            several advantages including low cost, reliability, ease of installation, low maintenance,
            accuracy and expanded functionality. In addition, this type of advanced sensor can
            be used as an integral part of a prognostic health management system. The acoustic
            wave sensor(s) can be one of several different types and configurations but the preferred
            version is that known in the art as a Shear Horizontal Surface Acoustic Wave (SH-SAW)
            device. This type of device works particularly well in the present air bleed valve
            system to sense the presence of air in hydraulic oil based system and can result in
            a more compact packaging which is easier to place within the aircraft.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">The exemplary air bleed valve system is particularly adaptable for use in aircraft
            in that the air can be accurately sensed and then vented when the aircraft is in a
            suitable flight regime. When connected to a flight control system, operation can be
            automatic instead of manual. The exemplary system is mounted at the highest point
            where the air in hydraulic system is collected and will bleed air effectively even
            during flight without manual intervention and will not allow fluid leakage from the
            pressurized hydraulic reservoir even when the aircraft is in a high G or inverted
            orientation. The use of acoustic wave sensors in the air bleed valve provides more
            accurate and dependable venting of the air in the hydraulic system. These acoustic
            wave sensors are reliable and relatively inexpensive compared to prior art sensors.
            The output of the acoustic wave sensors can be electrically connected to an electronic
            circuit such as a computer so that input and output signals can be processed and used
            to control when an activation signal is sent to the vent valve for discharge of the
            excess air in the hydraulic system. Or, the sensors can be electrically connected
            to a stand-alone circuit that controls the air bleed valve. This circuit can communicate
            with a flight computer system that signals when the aircraft is in a flight mode that
            is conducive to the opening of the vent valve.

         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">Moreover, a number of constants may be introduced in the discussion that follows.
            In some cases illustrative values of the constants are provided. In other cases, no
            specific values are given. The values of the constants will depend on characteristics
            of the associated hardware and the interrelationship of such characteristics with

            <b>10</b> that can sense hydraulic oil characteristics and utilizes a configuration known as
            a Shear Horizontal Surface Acoustic Wave (SH-SAW) device. An input transducer 
            <b>12</b> is formed on the surface of the piezoelectric substrate 
            <b>14</b> using a suitable thin film process and in a similar fashion; an output transducer
            
            <b>16</b> is also formed on the surface of the piezoelectric substrate 
            <b>14</b> using a thin film process such as a photolithographic technology that is well known
            in the art. An electrical signal is provided to the input transducer 
            <b>12</b> that will generate acoustic wave that propagates to the output (receiving) transducer
            
            <b>16</b> which generates an electrical signal that can be used to determine the properties
            of a fluid, such as hydraulic oil, that surrounds the piezoelectric substrate 
            <b>14</b>. Any change in physical, chemical, biological or electrical properties of media in
            contact with the acoustic wave sensor will cause corresponding change in the oscillating
            frequency of the acoustic wave generated by the input transducer

            <b>16</b> which generates an output electrical signal which can be connected to an electric
            circuit or a computer. The same principle is used to detect the presence or absence
            of a liquid which can be achieved when the piezoelectric substrate contacts the liquid
            and/or the air that is present and surrounds the acoustic wave sensor.

            lithium tantalite (LiTaO3), and lithium niobate (LiNbO3). Each has their own unique
            characteristics such as cost, temperature effects, attenuation and propagation velocity.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">The acoustic wave that propagates through the substrate is called a bulk wave. The
            most commonly used bulk acoustic wave (BAW) devices are the thickness shear mode (TSM)
            resonator and the shear-horizontal acoustic plate mode (SH-APM) sensor. If the wave
            propagates on the surface of the substrate, it is known as a surface wave. The most
            widely used surface wave devices are the surface acoustic wave sensor and the shear-horizontal
            surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) sensor as used in the present is also known as the
            surface transverse wave (STW) sensor.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">The acoustic wave devices can be used to sense many different physical parameters
            including gas but only a subset will work when in contact with liquids. The TSM, SH-APM
            and SH-SAW all generate waves that propagate primarily in the shear horizontal direction.
            The shear horizontal wave does not radiate significantly into liquids and thus, there
            is not significant damping of the wave by the liquid. This characteristic makes these
            particular acoustic wave devices suitable for use in liquids such as hydraulic oil
            of the exemplary air bleed system. The SH-SAW type of device is shown in the present
            exemplary acoustic wave sensing system (see figref[FIGS. 1-3]
            	 and figref[FIG. 7]
            	).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">SAW type sensors have the highest sensitivity of the acoustic sensors described above
            and typically operate from 25 to 500 MHz. In the case of liquid sensing, a SH-SAW
            should be used in that the wave propagation mode changes from a vertical shear SAW
            sensor to a shear-horizontal SAW sensor which dramatically reduces loss when liquids,
            such as hydraulic oil, come into contact with the sensor. The damping effect of the
            liquid is significantly reduced with the SH-SAW sensor which makes it suitable for
            use when detecting the presence and characteristics of liquids such as hydraulic oil.
            The acoustic wave sensors 
            <b>10</b>, 
            <b>10</b>A, 
            <b>10</b>B are shown as a SH-SAW type device. The range of phenomena that can be detected by
            this device can be determined by the coating used on the device. These devices can
            detect the characteristics of gas or liquids by coating the device with a material
            that undergo changes when exposed to the gas or liquid of interest. Changes in the
            coating cause the propagation of the wave to be changed which can be used to calculate
            the characteristics of the gas or liquid. The presence or absence of a liquid can
            thus be easily detected. If the particular acoustic wave sensor is sensitive to temperature
            changes, a second acoustic wave sensor can be used, either mounted in a non-stressed
            area of the substrate or a physically separate device can be used to compensate for
            changes in temperature.

         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">Now referring to figref[FIG. 7]
            	 of the drawings, a cross-sectional view of the present exemplary air bleed valve
            system 
            <b>50</b> is shown. The air bleed valve system 
            <b>50</b> consists of a housing 
            <b>51</b> which is connected to hydraulic reservoir and sealed with an O-ring 
            <b>52</b> to prevent any external leakage. The hydraulic fluid 
            <b>54</b> and the air within the hydraulic fluid 
            <b>54</b> from the hydraulic reservoir will come in passage 
            <b>53</b> and the air will be separated from the oil to form a volume 
            <b>55</b>. Two acoustic wave sensors 
            <b>56</b> and 
            <b>57</b> similar to either those shown in figref[FIGS. 1-3]
            	 are mounted in the housing 
            <b>51</b>. The sensor 
            <b>57</b> will be mounted in such a way that it will always be immersed in the hydraulic fluid
            
            <b>54</b> and acts as a temperature compensator. The sensor 
            <b>56</b> is mounted at a predetermined height inside the housing 
            <b>51</b> and works as a liquid sensing SH-SAW acoustic wave sensor. When it is submerged in
            oil, a vent valve 
            <b>59</b> remains closed and when the sensor 
            <b>56</b> signals that air is present in the volume 
            <b>55</b>, then the vent valve 
            <b>59</b> is opened to vent the air out of the volume 
            <b>55</b>. Oil then replaces the air that is vented.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0031" num="0030">The output signals from sensors 
            <b>56</b> and 
            <b>57</b> are sent to an air bleed controller 
            <b>65</b> which processes and then compares the two signals from sensors 
            <b>56</b> and 
            <b>57</b> respectively and uses the result to determine whether to close or open the vent valve
            
            <b>59</b>. The controller 
            <b>65</b> can be a separate circuit or part of a larger multi-functional processing circuit
            or it can be connected to a flight computer system 
            <b>67</b>. The vent valve 
            <b>59</b> can be a solenoid valve or a piezo actuator type valve or a voice coil based actuator
            or any other type of open and closing valve device. The valve 
            <b>59</b> closes or opens the passage 
            <b>60</b> to allow the air to travel from the volume 
            <b>55</b> into passage 
            <b>60</b> from where the air can be bleed outside the system through bleed port 
            <b>62</b>. The vent valve 
            <b>59</b> can be configured to be normally closed when no activation signal is present. The
            air bleed controller 
            <b>65</b> is an electronic circuit that can include a microprocessor that is programmed to
            process the electrical signals from the acoustic wave sensors 
            <b>56</b>, 
            <b>57</b>. The bleed controller 
            <b>65</b> then can send a signal to activate the vent valve 
            <b>59</b> if air is present in volume 
            <b>55</b> instead of hydraulic oil. The air is then released from the volume 
            <b>55</b> and is replaced by hydraulic fluid. At this time the sensors 
            <b>56</b> and 
            <b>57</b> should generate approximately equivalent output signals and the controller 
            <b>65</b> would remove the activation signal from the vent valve 
            <b>59</b> and it would close. Optionally, a flight computer system 
            <b>67</b> is connected to the bleed controller 
            <b>65</b> to signal when the aircraft is operating in a mode which is conducive to the venting
            of air from the hydraulic system.
