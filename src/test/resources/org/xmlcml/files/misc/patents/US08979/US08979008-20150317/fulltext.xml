<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to aggregate processing systems, rock crushing plants and other road building material processing systems. More specifically, this invention relates to mobile rock crushing and aggregate processing plants which are capable of being transported over public highways.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Several techniques and numerous equipment arrangements for moving rock crushing and aggregate processing plants from one location to another are known from the prior art. Particularly relevant to the present invention is the use of modular aggregate processing and systems where the components of the entire system can be broken down and transported via semi-trucks to another location. Typically, the modular aggregate processing and rock crushing system would be designed to be broken down in numerous trailerable independent units, including road building material handling and processing equipment, such as crushers, trommels, screens, etc. and material transport equipment such as conveyors, augers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While such prior art modular mobile aggregate processing and rock crushing systems have enjoyed considerable success in the past, they do have some drawbacks. Such modular mobile aggregate processing and rock crushing system designs often resulted in considerable setup time and the use of many semi-tractors to pull all of the units.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One prior art system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,935,587 issued to Brock et al. This patent describes a modular aggregate processing and rock crushing system which utilizes many trailers to transport the system. Inter-crusher/processing module conveyor trailers were used to interconnect the various crushing or processing stations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consequently, a need remains in the industry for an improved modular mobile aggregate processing and rock crushing system which provides for reduced setup and delivery time and expense, as well as reduced space requirements (footprints) for the system itself.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the invention is to provide a modular crushing system which requires reduced delivery and setup time and cost and reduced operating and fuel costs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of moving road building material handling systems from one location to another with reduced setup time, reduced need for additional equipment to aid in the setup process and reduced expense.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other and further objects of the invention, together with the features of novelty appurtenant thereto, may appear in the detailed description and the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention comprises a road building material handling and aggregate processing system which utilizes no or reduced inter-crusher/screen/plant independent conveyor trailers.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a pneumatic schematic diagram which is divided into two sections; the right section in the dashed lines represents the pneumatic structure on the rock crusher section <b>130</b>, while the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in the dashed line enclosure represents the pneumatic structure on the material feed section <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to the left section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown an independent height adjustable air supply line <b>402</b> and an independent height adjustable air supply line quick coupler component <b>404</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows two independent lines of differing length. In an alternate embodiment, one line could be used as the connection between independent height adjustable air supply line quick coupler component <b>404</b> and tractor-to-trailer air supply line quick connect coupler component <b>406</b>. This connection would not occur at the same time as a connection between independent height adjustable air supply line quick coupler component <b>404</b> and inter-section independent suspension height quick connect component <b>416</b>. Independent height adjustable air supply line quick coupler component <b>404</b> and tractor-to-trailer air supply line quick connect coupler component <b>406</b> may be standard airline quick connect or proprietary quick connects, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Independent height adjustable air supply line <b>402</b> provides air to feeder air supply reservoir <b>420</b>, which provides air to the brake system (if desired) and to feeder suspension height valve <b>424</b>, which adds or exhausts air to the feeder suspension air bag <b>428</b> via feeder section, independent to common suspension control valve <b>422</b>. Coupler <b>414</b>, and inter-section common suspension height quick connect component <b>440</b>, provide air to common supply line <b>412</b>, which provides air to feeder section independent to common suspension control valve <b>422</b> to shuttle feeder section independent to common suspension control valve <b>422</b> and overrides feeder suspension height valve <b>424</b> and provides pressure to feeder suspension air bag <b>428</b>, resulting in a common pressure in all air bags. Feeder suspension height valve <b>424</b> could be an industry standard height control valve or any suitable substitute.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It will be understood that certain features and sub-combinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and sub-combinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, there is shown an array of product piles and a system for processing road building materials. There is shown a bifurcatable crusher <b>100</b>, a surge bin material transfer apparatus <b>200</b>, and scalping screen <b>300</b> and a scalping screen to secondary cone input conveyor <b>302</b> and a secondary cone bypass conveyor <b>304</b>, which delivers the output of scalping screen <b>300</b> to the output of secondary cone crusher <b>400</b> without running the material through secondary cone crusher <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Bifurcatable crusher <b>100</b> can be a jaw crusher, such as those manufactured by Cedarapids Inc., or other type which has a significant weight which would exceed a maximum weight for a trailer to travel as one complete unit.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Scalping screen <b>300</b> may have various sized screens therein, but in one embodiment, it might have screens of the following sizes: 2.5 inches top deck, 1.25 inches middle deck, and a 0.875 inches bottom deck, all being 6&#x2032;&#xd7;20&#x2032;. Scalping screen <b>300</b> is shown outputting two (2) stockpiles, with a total of five (5) stockpiles for the entire system, but it should be understood that one embodiment of the present invention is capable of simultaneously outputting seven stockpiles, five of which could be blended (material which is known to be separated to different size ranges and then later combined). More details of the design and operation of scalping screen <b>300</b> will be understood when referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Secondary cone crusher <b>400</b> has one output conveyor, secondary cone output conveyor <b>470</b>, which accepts material from three sources, the output of the secondary cone crusher <b>400</b>, the secondary cone bypass conveyor <b>304</b> (at a common height), and the output conveyor of the tertiary cone crusher <b>500</b> (at a common height). In one embodiment, secondary cone crusher <b>400</b> could be an MVP-type cone crusher, as manufactured by Cedarapids, Inc., with a one-inch output setting. Secondary cone output conveyor <b>470</b> feeds finish screen <b>600</b> (at a common height) which has four (<b>4</b>) output conveyors, three (<b>3</b>) of which deliver material to stockpiles and another which loops material back around via tertiary cone crusher <b>500</b> to secondary cone output conveyor <b>470</b> (at a common height) and then back through finish screen <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Tertiary cone crusher <b>500</b> could also be an MVP-type cone crusher and, in one embodiment, could have a &#xbd;-inch output setting. Tertiary cone crusher <b>500</b> also has a common feed point height that is set to cooperate with the common output conveyor height of the scalping screen <b>300</b> and finish screen <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Finish screen <b>600</b> could, in one embodiment, be a triple deck screen with a 0.75-inch top deck, a 0.5-inch middle deck, and a 0.25-inch bottom deck, all of which could, in one embodiment, be an 8&#x2032;&#xd7;20&#x2032; screen.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">With the common output conveyor heights and the common feed point heights of the various components to the system, it is possible to customize a solution for a particular specification or application. For example, the mini plant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is enabled because of the common output and feed point heights across the various components. Control trailer <b>700</b> is the central control and power source for the various components. In one embodiment, the control trailer <b>700</b> may provide only control signals leaving the power supplying function to the generators <b>704</b> and <b>706</b>. In another arrangement, control trailer <b>700</b> could provide both. In still other embodiments, control trailer <b>700</b> could provide power, as well as additional generators <b>704</b> and <b>706</b>. Power supply and control wires <b>702</b> would connect the control trailer <b>700</b> with the various components. Having a small footprint for the system allows for short power supply lines between the control trailer <b>700</b> and the various other components. The shorter the power supply lines, the less resistance and the concomitant energy loss associated therewith. With less energy loss, a smaller generator can be used, thereby conserving fuel costs. Also, with shorter power supply lines, which are typically much larger than the lines that merely provide control signals, you get less weight and easier and quicker setup times. Alternatively, each component could have its own engine/generator system and could be connected together via a wired or wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It should be noted that the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> does not have any stand-alone single purpose inter-plant conveyor trailers; i.e., each conveyor in the system of the present invention is coupled to and combined with and transported as part of a function piece of equipment, which provides a function other than merely conveying material. The surge bin material transfer apparatus <b>200</b> provides the function of buffering irregular flows by temporarily storing material exiting the bifurcatable crusher <b>100</b> at times of high output flow. Additionally, in one embodiment, all of the inter-plant (between screen, crusher, and surge bin) conveyors used in the entire system are not configured to provide substantial vertical height adjustment of the discharge point. The use of such common discharge point heights from the various inter-plant conveyors enables faster setup times while preserving the ability to move the screens and crushers around to form different system configurations. One of the innovative methods of the present invention is to rearrange, add to, or omit from a first system, screens, crushers and surge bins, and thereby create a different combination without making any horizontal or vertical adjustments of the any discharge points of any inter-plant conveyors. The use of common discharge and common feed points for the various screens, crusher and surge bins allows for this to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The various screens, crushers, etc. are shown with wheels and tires thereon for providing the ability to transport them on a highway. However, it should also be understood that some embodiments of the present invention might include tracks instead of tires or in addition to tires. Even if the system is designed with tracks, many of the beneficial aspects of the invention are still achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown an overhead perspective view of a &#x201c;mini-plant&#x201d; embodiment of the present invention, which has fewer major components and occupies a smaller footprint than the system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> and provides fewer stockpiling conveyors. In particular, there is shown a system comprising bifurcatable crusher <b>100</b>, a scalping screen <b>300</b> and a secondary cone crusher <b>4000</b> and a control trailer <b>700</b>. Screen plant exiting conveyor <b>4300</b> provides material to the stockpiling conveyor <b>4310</b>. Numerous other stockpiling conveyors are fed by similar exiting conveyors. The scalping screen <b>300</b> has a returning output conveyor <b>4200</b>, which provides an output with predetermined characteristics to the surge bin <b>4100</b>, which feeds the cone crusher feed conveyor <b>4400</b>, which delivers the material to the top opening of the cone crusher <b>4500</b>, which then provides an output on conveyor <b>4600</b> to an output conveyor on bifurcatable crusher <b>100</b>, which then delivers the material directly to an input onboard conveyor for the scalping screen <b>300</b>, where the material is screened a second time and delivered to the appropriate stockpiles. With the mini-plant, it may be necessary to give extra care to the rate and nature of material entering the bifurcatable crusher <b>100</b>, as there is no surge capacity as is provided by the surge bin material transfer apparatus <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. The mini plant does have a further advantage in that the power supply lines from the control trailer <b>700</b> are shorter, thereby reducing energy loss related to electrical resistance, which increases with length of the power supply lines. The mini plant as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> could be operated without additional generators, where the only source of power is the control trailer <b>700</b>. The lack of independent conveyor trailers deployed in between the crushers and screens and the necessary space to maneuver such trailers is noticeable, especially with respect to the mini plant. However, in some embodiments, it is desired to leave space between the trailers sufficient to allow small skid steer-type loaders to gain access to areas where cleanup is needed. The present invention, with all conveyors being disposed onboard a trailer containing structure to perform a function additional to merely transporting the material, provides the ability for this small footprint. Additionally, in one embodiment, all of the inter-plant (between screen, crusher, and surge bin) conveyors used in the entire system are not configured to provide substantial vertical height adjustment of the discharge point. A surge bin material transfer apparatus <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) is understood to provide a buffering ability to accommodate substantial surges in output of a crusher or diminution in acceptance by a screen. Note that structure at the very end of a conveyor which helps to deflect material and provides only very minor buffering ability, such as the deflecting structure <b>1907</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>), is considered herein and in the claims not to provide substantial buffering for surges. The multiple common feed point height and output conveyor heights allow for flexibility in configuring an aggregate processing system for a particular need.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is shown an upwardly looking perspective view of the scalping screen <b>300</b>, which displays the multiple common conveyor output aspect of the present invention, which includes the scalping screen to secondary cone input conveyor <b>302</b> (at a first common height), secondary cone bypass conveyor <b>304</b> (at a second common height) and the first under conveyor tail <b>3002</b> coupled to the first under conveyor head <b>3012</b> (at a third common height).

Lower blending chute to fines blending chute transfer chute <b>3032</b> accepts material from lower blending chute <b>3030</b>, which contains gate assembly <b>1006</b> and variably provides material to lower blending chute to fines blending chute transfer chute <b>3032</b> and/or lower blending chute to blending conveyor transfer chute <b>3034</b>. Lower blending chute to blending conveyor transport chute <b>3034</b> provides material to scalping screen second blending conveyor <b>3016</b>. Upper blending chute <b>3040</b>, which contains gate assembly <b>1004</b>, variably provides material to lower blending chute <b>3030</b> and/or transverse blending chute <b>3050</b>.

Note that pant-leg chute <b>3036</b> comprises two separate chutes that straddle scalping screen blending conveyor <b>3010</b> and scalping screen second blending conveyor <b>3016</b>.</p>

Note the dashed lines represent material paths that did not carry material in the selected evaluation scenario. The process begins with bifurcatable crusher <b>100</b> crushing material to be processed, then surge bin material transfer apparatus <b>200</b> transports the material to the scalping screen <b>3300</b>, where it is graphically depicted as having three (3) stacked screens, top deck <b>3102</b>, mid deck <b>3104</b> and lower deck <b>3106</b>.

It is believed that once the sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1500</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>) is understood and the innovative instruction to substitute is made herein, then the substitution would be capable of being carried out by one having ordinary skill in the art.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">One noteworthy feature of the scalping screen <b>3300</b> is that, in one embodiment, there is a stacked series of four gravity-fed diverters for variably directing the middle deck overs.

The overs of finish screen top deck, which could be a &#xbe;-inch screen, go to tertiary cone crusher <b>500</b>. The overs of the mid deck, which could be a &#xbd;-inch screen, go to sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1100</b> (which could be similar to gate assembly <b>1002</b>), which provides material to either sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1102</b> (which could be similar to gate assembly <b>1004</b>) or to tertiary cone crusher <b>500</b>.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The present invention provides a level of blending control, which has been very difficult to achieve in a mobile aggregate crushing system. Often road builders will give a specification for base aggregate of having a maximum percentage of fines less than X inches. Often operators of rock crushers and aggregate processing systems would attempt to minimize the fines in the delivered road blend product. This minimization of the fines results in a higher level of less desirable rock. With this level of control, it provides the plant operator with the ability to include a controlled amount of fines (just under the limit of the road blend specification) instead of building a larger stockpile of waste rock. This notion of transforming otherwise waste rock into usable material results in increased profits for the plant.</p>

Disposed between sliding fixed forward flow directing plate <b>1510</b> and sliding fixed backflow directing plate <b>1506</b> is sliding swing gate <b>1512</b>, which can be pivoted or swung in one direction or the other to selectively direct material in either the forward or backward direction. Sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> pivoted in a forward direction, which mimics the positioning of sliding fixed backflow directing plate <b>1506</b> and, therefore, results in material exiting through backward flow exit chute <b>1522</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Sliding fixed backflow directing plate <b>1506</b>, sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> and sliding fixed forward flow directing plate <b>1510</b> may be coupled in a linear fashion, so that they can all be forced to slide or translate back and forth as a single unit. Sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> is always located fully within the material contacting portion sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1500</b>, and the sliding fixed backflow directing plate <b>1506</b> and sliding fixed forward flow directing plate <b>1510</b> may be located between 100% to 0% within the zone under material entry top chute <b>1502</b> which contacts the material.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As the sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> pivots from one position to the next, it is bounded on one side by the sliding swing gate backward side limit plate <b>1514</b> and on the opposing side by the sliding swing gate forward side limit plate <b>1516</b>. When sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> is fully deployed to one position, the top end of sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> rests upon either the sliding swing gate rear rail <b>1530</b> or the opposing sliding swing gate front rail <b>1532</b>, which together also provide for structural support in general of the sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1500</b>. Sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> while in the process of pivoting between operating positions. The translational position of sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> is shown at approximately a 25 to 75 percent sharing setting. As sliding swing gate forward side limit plate <b>1516</b> moves closer, during the incremental adjustment process, to forward side end plate <b>1556</b>, the sharing percentage between forward diversion and backward diversion will change and become more extreme; e.g., a ten percent to ninety percent sharing setting. Then as sliding swing gate forward side limit plate <b>1516</b> contacts endplate <b>1516</b>, the sharing will be 0 to 100 percent. However, if the sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> were then pivoted, it would become a 50-50 sharing.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In operation, the sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1500</b> could function as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Material is output from a source of material, either overs, fines or a previously blended combination of the same. The material goes through a material entry top chute <b>1502</b> and drops upon the sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1500</b>. Depending upon the positioning under the material entry top chute <b>1502</b> of the slide assembly (which comprises sliding fixed backflow inclined directing plate <b>1506</b>, sliding fixed forward flow inclined directing plate <b>1510</b> and sliding swing gate <b>1512</b>), the material will flow in some set percentage to either the forward flow exit chute <b>1520</b> or the backward flow exit chute <b>1522</b>. If a different mix of percentages is desired, then the slide assembly of sliding fixed backflow directing plate <b>1506</b>, sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> and sliding fixed forward flow directing plate <b>1510</b>, can be slid one way or the other to make an infinitely variable diversion of material through the sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1500</b>. While the sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1500</b> is capable of infinite variability, it should be understood that the variations are not necessarily continuous. To go from a mixture with 47% forward, then to 49% forward, and finally to a mixture of 51% going forward, requires more than a continuation of the movement which resulted in an increase from 47% to 49%. The process would involve both flipping the sliding swing gate <b>1512</b> and sliding the same gate nearly completely to one side of the space under material entry top chute <b>1502</b>; i.e., either minimizing or maximizing the gap between sliding swing gate forward side limit plate <b>1516</b> and end plate <b>1556</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">It is believed that the combination of a sliding and swing gate provide for the ability to have a fully adjustable flow while reducing the vertical height of the apparatus to selectively divert flow. The small vertical height of sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1500</b> allows for the more sliding swing gate blending assemblies <b>1500</b> to be stacked within the area below the output of the various screens of scalping screen <b>300</b>. Therefore, this novel component provides for increased compactness of the scalping screen <b>300</b> with a high degree of blending controls.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-23</figref>, there is shown a side view of a folding conveyor <b>1900</b> of the present invention, together with a hopper/material intake location <b>1902</b>, disposed in a position to receive material from the folding conveyor <b>1900</b>. Hopper/material intake location is simply shown as an arrow to suggest the orientation of a side of the hopper and the flow direction of material in the hopper, etc. It should be understood that much more structure would be associated with such a hopper, and the arrow is merely intended to indicate the intake location or a side of the hopper.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Folding conveyor <b>1900</b> has a folding conveyor discharge end <b>1904</b> and a folding conveyor intake end <b>1906</b>, and is divided into two sections which are movable with respect to each other, folding conveyor discharge section <b>1910</b> and folding conveyor intake section <b>1912</b>, which are joined by folding conveyor section hinge <b>1914</b>. Folding conveyor <b>1900</b> could be mounted to a material intake of scalping screen <b>300</b>, an intake of the surge bin material transfer apparatus <b>200</b> or a stand alone dedicated trailer, or it could be mounted to a trailer also carrying additional or other functional components. A folding conveyor central cam/arch <b>1920</b> is pivotally (capable of being pivoted) coupled at one point to a base, such as a trailer (not shown). Folding conveyor intake arm linkage <b>1922</b> is pivotally coupled at one end to folding conveyor central cam/arch <b>1920</b> and at an opposing end to folding conveyor intake end <b>1906</b>. Folding conveyor midrange arm linkage <b>1924</b> is pivotally coupled at one end to folding conveyor central cam/arch <b>1920</b> and at an opposing end to an intermediate position of folding conveyor discharge section <b>1910</b>. Folding conveyor intermediate arm linkage <b>1926</b> is pivotally coupled at one end to folding conveyor central cam/arch <b>1920</b> and at an opposing end to folding conveyor cam/drive head <b>1928</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Folding conveyor intermediate cam/drive head <b>1928</b> is pivotally attached to link <b>1926</b> and also pivotally attached to head support <b>1930</b> and hydraulic cylinder to intermediate cam connecting linkage <b>1936</b>. The attachment to folding conveyor intermediate arm linkage <b>1926</b> and hydraulic cylinder to intermediate cam connecting linkage <b>1936</b> are at the same point. Linkage arm <b>1932</b> is pivotally coupled to connecting linkage <b>1936</b> at pin <b>1992</b>. Hydraulic cylinder <b>1934</b> attaches to an ear on linkage arm <b>1932</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In operation, the folding conveyor is caused to retract from the hopper/material intake location <b>1902</b>, as would happen when a job is finished and the folding conveyor <b>1900</b> is being readied for transport. The simple automated operation of the folding conveyor <b>1900</b> results in a reduced overall height and length, as well as increased separation from the hopper/material intake location <b>1902</b>. The points of attachment to the trailer (not shown) are the free ends of hydraulic cylinder <b>1934</b>, folding conveyor cam/drive head <b>1928</b>, hydraulic cylinder distal end to vehicle linkage arm <b>1932</b> and folding conveyor central cam/arch <b>1920</b> (adjacent to the point where hydraulic cylinder <b>1934</b> is coupled to the trailer). It is possible that hydraulic cylinder <b>1934</b> is the only hydraulic cylinder, or other power assisting mechanism, used to successfully simultaneously retract, lower the overall height and shorten the overall length all with one sweeping motion initiated with a single actuation on the single control coupled to and controlling the hydraulic cylinder <b>1934</b>. In one embodiment, the same linkage, etc. structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is disposed on the opposite side of the folding conveyor <b>1900</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The folding conveyor central cam <b>1920</b>, and said folding conveyor intermediate cam <b>1928</b>, are configured so that when said hydraulic cylinder <b>1934</b> is extended, the folding conveyor discharge section <b>1904</b> first retracts away from, then drops below a receiving bin <b>1902</b> location, while the folding conveyor intake section <b>1907</b> moves first downward and inward, so that an overall height characteristic is less and an overall length characteristic is less than when said hydraulic cylinder <b>1934</b> is retracted.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the three pivot points <b>1990</b>, <b>1992</b> and <b>1994</b> are in alignment, enabling a retaining pin <b>1996</b> to be inserted through a pin receiving hole <b>1998</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) to lock the folding conveyor <b>1900</b> in an operating position.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-23</figref> show the folding conveyor <b>1900</b> in configurations of increasing departure from the operating position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a perspective view of the scalping screen <b>300</b> shown with the various conveyors stowed.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows the material feeder section input hopper <b>112</b> with the material feeder section folding wings <b>118</b>, where, for illustrative purposes, one material feeder section folding wing is folded down for transport, while the other is deployed in an operating position.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">More specifically, there is shown a hydraulic cylinder <b>2500</b>, which pushes link <b>2502</b> beyond a toggle point, which is defined when all three pivot pins <b>2506</b>, <b>2508</b>, and <b>2510</b> are in alignment, which locks the material feeder section folding wings <b>118</b> in place by pushing against an adjustable stop <b>2512</b> mounted on the material feeder section input hopper <b>112</b> body. When hydraulic cylinder <b>2500</b> pushes the links <b>2502</b> and <b>2504</b> beyond the toggle point, then the weight of the material feeder section folding wings <b>118</b> and any load thereon causes the link to move closer to the adjustable stop <b>2512</b> without further application of force by the hydraulic cylinder <b>2500</b>. This results in longer life of the seal in the hydraulic cylinder <b>2500</b> and allows for the hydraulic cylinder <b>2500</b> to be removed, repaired or replaced while the material feeder section folding wings <b>118</b> are deployed in an operating position. To stow the material feeder section folding wings <b>118</b>, the hydraulic cylinder <b>2500</b> pulls the link <b>2502</b>, which then causes the link <b>2504</b> to also move away from the adjustable stop and to a stowed position for transport.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, there is shown a perspective view of a configuration of a finishing screen <b>600</b> of the present invention with four conveyors, which is similar to the scalping screen <b>300</b>. Where numerals are used which are common with the scalping screen <b>300</b>, the differences between the finishing and scalping screens are believed to be minor.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, there is shown a finishing screen <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, which shows various flows of overs materials from the various decks. Top deck <b>3102</b> is shown with an output of top deck over material, which clearly directs such material to the scalping screen to secondary cone input conveyor <b>302</b>. Overs from mid deck <b>3104</b> are directed through first fines blending chute <b>3020</b>. The sliding swing gate blending assembly <b>1100</b> can take the form of four pluggable holes in a floor portion of the discharge lip or other gates of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The function of the present invention could be better understood by now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. There is shown a scalping screen <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, which shows various flows of overs materials from the various decks. The flows from the various decks are shown directed through the gates and on to the scalping screen to secondary cone input conveyor <b>302</b> and the secondary cone bypass conveyor <b>304</b>.
