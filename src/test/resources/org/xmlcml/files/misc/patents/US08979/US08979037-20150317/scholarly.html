         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a cable tray apparatus for use with a people mover system
            such as a Sky Train or the like. Even more particularly, the cable trays which make
            up the cable tray apparatus of this invention are identical and are secured together
            in an end-to-end relationship at one side of the cars of the people mover system.
            Even more particularly, this invention relates to a means for securing the cable trays
            together which permits the cable trays to be selectively laterally horizontally adjustable
            with respect to one another and selectively vertically adjustable with respect to
            one another.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">In people mover systems such as a Sky Train system, a plurality of vehicles or cars
            travel along a guideway or roadway with the guideway or roadway being normally elevated.
            Power and control signals for the cars normally comprise cables positioned in trays
            which are positioned on the roadway on one side of the cars traveling on the roadway.
            In the past, it is believed that the cable trays had to be cut and welded together
            to accommodate curves in the roadway and to accommodate elevational changes in the
            roadway.

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form
            that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not
            intended to identify key aspects or essential aspects of the claimed subject matter.
            Moreover, this Summary is not intended for use as an aid in determining the scope
            of the claimed subject matter.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">A cable tray apparatus is provided for use with an electric train such as a Sky Train
            which travels along a power rail positioned on a roadway with the train including
            one or more cars having opposite sides. A plurality of generally rectangular electrical
            cable trays make up the cable tray apparatus with the cable trays having first and
            second ends and being identical to one another. The cable trays are connected together
            in an end-to-end relationship and are positioned on the roadway at one side of the
            cars of the train. The cable trays are selectively laterally horizontally adjustable
            with respect to one another and are selectively vertically adjustable with respect
            to one another to correspond to curves in the roadway and to correspond to elevational
            changes in the roadway respectively.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each of the cable trays include a body portion having a cover selectively removably
            mounted on the upper end thereof. A plurality of upstanding partitions are provided
            in each of the body portions of the cable trays to provide a compartment for low-voltage
            cables, a compartment for high-voltage cables and a compartment for cables carrying
            control signals for the cars. The partitions not only stabilize the body portion but
            act as heat sinks.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">One or more low-voltage lights are secured to one side of each of the cable trays
            which illuminate the roadway adjacent the cable tray apparatus. The cable tray apparatus
            will serve as a walkway or step to a walkway should the passengers be required to
            leave the car if the car becomes disabled and must stop along the length of the system.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">The cover is selectively removably secured to the upper end of the body portion and
            the upper end of the partitions and is connected to the body portion by a flexible
            tether means so that the cover may be placed at one side of the cable tray should
            the cover need to be removed with the tether preventing the cover from falling from
            the roadway.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other objects will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
