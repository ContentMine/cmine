<p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the conventional external material clamping structure for fixing the external material <b>50</b> to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall of the building with the external material clamp A. (Refer to Patent Literature 1 hereinafter explained) The external material clamp A comprises a fixed plate <b>1</b>, a horizontal plate <b>2</b>, an upper support plate <b>3</b>, and a lower support plate <b>4</b>. The horizontal plate <b>2</b> extends to a front direction from a center of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The upper support plate extends to an upper direction from a front end of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The lower support plate <b>4</b> extends to the lower direction from the front end of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The external material clamp A is fixed to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall of the building with the fixation member <b>61</b> such as the nail and the screw under the condition where the fixation member <b>61</b> passes through the fixation hole <b>10</b> of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The external material <b>50</b> is inserted at its lower engagement portion <b>53</b> into the space between the upper support plate <b>3</b> and the fixed plate <b>1</b> of the external material clamp A, whereby the engagement between the lower engagement portion <b>53</b> of the external material <b>50</b> and the space is established. In addition, the external material <b>50</b> is inserted at its upper engagement portion <b>54</b> into the space between the lower support plate <b>4</b> and the fixed plate <b>1</b> of another external material clamp A, whereby the engagement between the upper engagement portion <b>54</b> of the external material and the space is established. According to repeating the above work to fix a plurality of the external materials in the vertical direction, the exterior wall of the building is formed. In addition, the upstanding member <b>11</b> is formed to project to a front direction from both lateral portion of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. Consequently, the external material <b>50</b> is fixed to the foundation of the wall <b>60</b> to leave a ventilation space <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the above external material clamping structure, the external material in an upper side is disposed such that the load of the external material in an upper side is applied to the upper surface of the external material in a lower side. That is, the lower end of the external material <b>50</b> is provided with a cover <b>51</b> which extends to the lower direction to cover the lower support plate <b>4</b> of the external material clamp A. The lower surface of the cover <b>51</b> is in a contact with the contact surface of an upper end of the external material in the lower side. The load of the external material of the upper side is applied to the contact portion of the external material <b>50</b> of the lower side.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the external material clamping structure, there is a possibility of applying large load to the external material <b>50</b> of the lower side. Especially, when attaching a plurality of the external material <b>50</b> in the vertical direction, the external material <b>50</b> in a lower side of the wall receives the load of a plurality of the external materials <b>50</b>. That is, the large load is applied to the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side of the wall. Applying the large load to the exterior wall <b>50</b> causes the problem such as the breakage and the deformation of the external material <b>50</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The receiving plate <b>5</b> is preferably realized by the receiving fixed plate <b>8</b>. The receiving fixed plate <b>8</b> is formed by cutting out a part of the fixed plate <b>1</b> to extend to the front direction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is preferred that the lower support plate <b>4</b> comprises a fixing support plate <b>9</b>. The fixing support plate <b>9</b> is configured to contact with the front surface of the upper end portion of the external material in the lower side to hold the external material <b>50</b> between &#x201c;the fixing support plate <b>9</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;the fixed plate <b>1</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, the fixing support plate <b>9</b> preferably comprises a clipping plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>and a clipping tip <b>9</b><i>b</i>. The clipping plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>extends to the rear-lower direction from the horizontal plate. The clipping tip <b>9</b><i>b </i>extends to the front-lower direction from the lower end of the clipping plate <b>9</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, the lower support plate preferably comprises a pair of the lower support plates. The lower support plates are arranged in the lateral direction of the fixed plate. The fixing support plate <b>9</b> is formed between the lower support plates.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The external material clamp A preferably comprises the fixation rib <b>21</b>. The fixation rib <b>21</b> is provided to an upper end portion of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixation rib <b>21</b> is formed over a lateral direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixation rib <b>21</b> is a plate which is bent so as to project to the front direction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The fixation rib <b>21</b> comprises a lower inclination plate and an upper inclination plate. The lower inclination plate extends to the front-upper direction from the upper end of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The upper inclination plate extends to the rear-upper direction from the upper end of the lower inclination plate.

The sub plate extends to the front-upper direction from a front end of the lateral center of the horizontal plate. The main plate extends to the lower direction from the front end of the sub plate. Consequently, the lower support plate is cooperative with the front end of the horizontal plate to form the lower support rib. The lower support rib is formed over a lateral direction of the fixed plate. The lower support rib has a third cross section which is perpendicular to the lateral direction of the fixed plate. The third cross section has an L-shape.</p>

Each the upstanding member has a second length along a thickness direction of the fixed plate. The second length is shorter than the first length.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is preferred that each the upstanding member comprises an upstanding front plate and an upstanding side plate. The upstanding front plate extends to the front direction from the fixed plate. The upstanding side plate extends to the lateral direction from the front end of the upstanding front plate. The upstanding member is provided at its upper end portion with a smoothly curved surface.

The horizontal projection member is formed to project to the upper direction. The horizontal projection member has an upper surface which is a flat surface. (The horizontal projection member has an upper surface which is approximately flat surface.)</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, the horizontal projection member is located in the lateral center of the horizontal plate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the horizontal projection member preferably comprises the receiving horizontal plate. The receiving horizontal plate extends to the front-upper direction from the horizontal projection member. The receiving horizontal plate defines the receiving plate.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, it is preferred to employ the external material clamping structure for fixing the external materials to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall of the building with the external material clamp A of the above configuration. The external material clamp A has the fixed plate <b>1</b> fixed to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall. The external material <b>50</b> fixed to the lower side of the external material clamp A is engaged at its upper end with the lower support plate <b>4</b>, whereby the external material fixed is supported by the external material clamp A. The external material <b>50</b> fixed to an upper side of the external material clamp A is engaged at its lower end with the upper support plate <b>3</b>, whereby the external material <b>50</b> is supported by the external material clamp A. In addition, the external material clamp A is in contact at its lower end with both &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;the external material fixed to the lower side&#x201d;. Consequently, the load of the external material <b>50</b> fixed to an upper side is shared by &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d;.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">This invention discloses the external material clamp which comprises a receiving plate. At least a part of the receiving plate is located above the horizontal plate. Therefore, a part of the load of the external material in the upper side is supported by the receiving plate. Consequently, it is possible to fix a plurality of the external materials with prevention of applying the excess load to the external material in the lower side. Therefore, even if the large load is caused by fixing and arranging a plurality of the external materials in the vertical direction, it is possible to prevent the breakage and the deformation of the external material. That is, the load of the external material in the upper side is shared by &#x201c;the external material in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving plate of the external material clamp&#x201d;. Therefore, applying the excess load to the external material in the lower side is prevented. Further, the receiving plate receives a part of the load of the external material. Therefore, there is no possibility that only the receiving plate receives the excess load. So, it is possible to damage the foundation of the wall. Consequently, applying the excess load to the external material as well as applying the load to the foundation of the wall is prevented. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the breakage and the deformation of the external material.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, the receiving plate is realized by the receiving support plate which is formed by cutting out the upper support plate. Therefore, additional work is not required, compared with a case where the receiving plate is formed by the separate components. Therefore, it is possible to easily form the receiving plate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, the receiving plate is realized by the receiving horizontal plate which is formed by cutting out a horizontal plate. Consequently, there is no need to perform additional work if the receiving plate is formed by the separate components. Therefore, it is possible to easily form the receiving plate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, the receiving plate is realized by the receiving fixed plate which is formed by cutting out a part of the fixed plate. Consequently, there is no need to perform additional work if the receiving plate is formed by the separate components. Therefore, it is possible to easily form the receiving plate.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, the lower support plate is provided with the fixing support plate projected to the fixed plate from the lower support plate. Therefore, an upper end portion of the external material in the lower side is held and fixed between the fixing support plate and the fixed plate. Therefore, it is possible to support the external material with reducing the backlash.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, the structure uses the external material clamp with the receiving plate. A load of the external material in the upper side is shared by &#x201c;the receiving plate of the external material clamp&#x201d; and &#x201c;The external material in the lower side&#x201d;. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the excess load from being applied to the external material. Furthermore, the receiving plate receives a part of the load of the external material. Therefore, there is no possibility that the excess load is applied to only the receiving plate, whereby there is no possibility of damaging the foundation of the wall. Therefore, it is possible to prevent both &#x201c;the applying the load to the foundation of the wall&#x201d; and &#x201c;applying excess load to the receiving plate&#x201d;. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the breakage and the deformation of the external material.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Hereinafter, the embodiments of this invention are explained.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> each show one embodiment of the external material clamp A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the external material clamping structure indicating the external material <b>50</b> fixed to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall with the external material clamp A.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The external material clamp A comprises the fixed plate <b>1</b>, the horizontal plate <b>2</b>, the upper support plate <b>3</b>, and the lower support plate <b>4</b>. The horizontal plate <b>2</b> extends to a front direction from a center of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The upper support plate <b>3</b> extends to the upper direction from the front end of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The lower support plate <b>4</b> extends to the lower direction from the front end of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The external material clamp A is manufactured by way of, for example, &#x201c;cutting the metal plate&#x201d; and &#x201c;bending the metal plate&#x201d;, arbitrarily. In the illustrated embodiment, the horizontal plate <b>2</b>, the upper plate <b>3</b>, and the lower plate <b>4</b> are formed by cutting out from a part of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. Therefore, the fixed plate <b>1</b> is provided at its lower portion with an opening <b>20</b>. In this invention, the definition of the center of the fixed plate <b>1</b> is &#x201c;a portion of the fixed plate <b>1</b>&#x201d; which is other than the upper end of the fixed plate <b>1</b> and also other than the lower end of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The horizontal plate <b>2</b> may be formed in a position in an upper half of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. Similarly, the horizontal plate may be formed in a position in a lower half of the fixed plate.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The fixed plate <b>1</b> is defined as a main body of the external material clamp A to be fixed to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall of the building. The fixed plate <b>1</b> is provided with the fixation hole <b>10</b> which is used when the fixed plate <b>1</b> is fixed to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall by the fixation member <b>61</b> such as nail and the screw. The fixed plate <b>1</b> is provided at its upper end with a fixation rib <b>21</b>. The fixation rib <b>21</b> is provided for reinforce the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixation rib <b>21</b> is formed over a lateral direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixation rib <b>21</b> is a bending portion of the fixed plate <b>1</b> to have an L-shaped cross section so as to be projected to the front direction. The fixed plate <b>1</b> is provided at its lower end with a fixation rib <b>22</b>. The fixation rib <b>22</b> is provided for reinforce the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixation rib <b>22</b> is formed over a lateral direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixation rib <b>22</b> has a C-shaped cross section so as to be projected to the front direction. In addition, both the lateral end of the fixed plate <b>1</b> is provided with projection members <b>11</b>. Each the upstanding member <b>11</b> is projected to the front direction to have a projection length which is shorter than the projection length of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The projection members <b>11</b> are provided for leaving the aeration space <b>62</b> between &#x201c;the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall&#x201d; and &#x201c;The external material <b>50</b>&#x201d;. Each the upstanding member <b>11</b> comprises a projection-front plate <b>12</b> and the projection-side plate <b>13</b>. The projection-front plate <b>12</b> is formed to project to the front direction from the side end of the fixed plate <b>1</b> such that the projection-front plate <b>12</b> is approximately perpendicular to the side end of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The projection-side plate <b>13</b> is formed to project to a direction opposite of the fixed plate from the front end of the projection-front plate <b>12</b> such that the projection-side plate is approximately perpendicular to the projection-front plate <b>12</b>. The upper end and the lower end of the upstanding member <b>11</b> are formed to have smoothly-curved surfaces which connect the fixed plate <b>1</b> with the projection-front plate <b>12</b> and the projection-side plate <b>13</b> smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The horizontal plate <b>2</b> is formed to project to the front direction from the fixed plate <b>1</b> to be approximately perpendicular to the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The horizontal plate <b>2</b> is projected to have the projection length which is greater than the projection length of the upstanding member <b>11</b>. Consequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lower engagement member <b>53</b> of the external material <b>50</b> is inserted into and engaged with the space between the upstanding member <b>11</b> and the upper support plate <b>3</b>. Further, the upper engagement member <b>54</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side is inserted into and engaged with the space between the upstanding member <b>11</b> and the lower support plate <b>4</b>. Consequently, supporting and attaching the external materials <b>50</b> in the vertical direction is established. The horizontal plate <b>2</b> and the fixed plate <b>1</b> have a boundary portion therebetween. The boundary portion is provided at its both lateral ends with horizontal ribs <b>23</b>, respectively. The horizontal ribs <b>23</b> are provided for reinforce the strength between the horizontal plate <b>2</b> and the fixed plate <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> C, the horizontal rib <b>23</b> is formed to project upper-front direction. In addition, the horizontal plate <b>2</b> is provided at its center with a horizontal projection member <b>14</b>. The horizontal projection member <b>14</b> is projected to the upper direction. The top of the horizontal projection member <b>14</b> has an approximately flat surface. The horizontal projection member <b>14</b> acts as the rib to reinforce the strength of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The horizontal plate <b>2</b> is required to have a form such that the horizontal plate <b>2</b> engages with two external materials in the vertical direction. Therefore, the horizontal plate <b>2</b> may be inclined to extend in a direction such as obliquely-upper direction and obliquely-lower direction. That is to say, there is no need for the fixed plate <b>1</b> to be perpendicular to the fixed plate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The upper support plate <b>3</b> in the embodiment of the figure has two upper support plates <b>3</b>. The upper support plates <b>3</b> are formed to the both lateral ends of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>, respectively. The upper support plate <b>3</b> projects from the front end of the horizontal plate to the upper direction with forwardly-inclination. Consequently, the lower engagement member <b>53</b> of the external material <b>50</b> is improved its insertability into the space between the fixed plate <b>1</b> and the upper support plate <b>3</b>. The upper support plate <b>3</b> and the horizontal plate <b>2</b> are formed to have the boundary portion therebetween. The upper support rib <b>24</b> is provided for reinforce the strength between the upper support plate <b>3</b> and the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The boundary portion is provided with the upper support rib <b>24</b>. The upper support rib <b>24</b> projects to the upper direction with backwardly-inclination.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The lower support plate <b>4</b> is formed to project to the lower direction from the center of the front end portion of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The lower support plate <b>4</b> is projected approximately in parallel with the fixed plate <b>1</b>. Further, the horizontal plate <b>2</b> is provided at its front end with a lower support rib <b>25</b> which is branched from the two upper support plates <b>3</b>. The lower support rib <b>25</b> has a first section extending to the front direction with slight-upward-inclination and a second section which is bent to extend to the lower direction from the first section. The lower support rib <b>25</b> has an L-shaped cross section which is formed by the lower support plate <b>4</b> and the front end of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The lower support rib <b>25</b> is provided to a boundary portion between the horizontal plate <b>2</b> and the lower support plate <b>4</b> over a lateral direction.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition, the external material clamp A of this invention further comprises the receiving plate <b>5</b> which is in abutting contact with the external material <b>50</b> attached to the upper side of the external material clamp A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> show the embodiment comprises the receiving plate <b>5</b>. The receiving plate <b>5</b> is a receiving support plate <b>6</b> which is formed by cutting out a part of the upper support plate <b>3</b> to extend to the fixed plate <b>1</b>. As explained above, if the receiving plate <b>5</b> is formed by the cutting out, there is no need to perform the additional complex work required when the receiving plate <b>5</b> is realized by the separate components of another receiving plate. So, it is possible to easily form the receiving plate <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The receiving support plate <b>6</b> is formed by cutting out the inside portion of the lower end of the two upper support plates <b>3</b> at the lower side of the receiving support plate <b>6</b>. The receiving support plate <b>6</b> extends to the fixed plate <b>1</b> to be approximately perpendicular to the fixed plate <b>1</b>. That is, the receiving support plate <b>6</b> is approximately in parallel with the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. That is, the receiving support plate <b>6</b> has a cantilever structure which is coupled with the upper support plate <b>3</b> in the lateral direction. The receiving support plate <b>6</b> is formed to have a same position or an upper position of the upper surface of the horizontal projection member <b>14</b> of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the external material <b>50</b> is attached such that the lower engagement member <b>53</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is inserted into the space between the upstanding member <b>11</b> and the upper support plate <b>3</b>, the lower surface of the lower engagement member <b>53</b> is in contact with the receiving support plate <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, the method of fixing the external material <b>50</b> with the external material clamp A is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The external material <b>50</b> having the rectangular shape having the long side in the lateral direction may be used. The external material <b>50</b> is provided at its upper end portion with the upper engagement member <b>54</b> which is formed over an entire length of the upper engagement member and which is projected to the upper direction. The upper engagement member <b>54</b> is formed near the back side of the external material <b>50</b>. The external material <b>50</b> has the upper end surface which is defined as the contact surface <b>52</b>. The external material <b>50</b> is provided at its lower end portion with the lower engagement member <b>53</b> and the cover member <b>51</b>. The lower engagement member <b>53</b> is formed over an entire length and is projected to the lower direction. The cover member <b>51</b> is formed to project to the lower direction to have a projection size greater than that of the lower engagement member <b>53</b>. The lower engagement member <b>53</b> is formed near the back side of the external material <b>50</b>. The cover member <b>51</b> is formed near the front side of the external material <b>50</b>. By using the external material <b>50</b> having the above explained shape, the external material <b>50</b> is fixed to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall without directly fixing the external material to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall by the fixation member. In addition, after fixing the external material clamp A, the external material clamp A is concealed so as not to expose to the outside. Therefore, it is possible to easily form the exterior of the building with good design.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Firstly, after aligning the position of the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side with respect to the external material clamp A, the external material clamp A is disposed to a predetermined position of the surface of the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall. Then, fixing the fixed plate on the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall with striking the fixation member <b>61</b> such as nail and the screw through the fixation hole <b>10</b> is made. The structure in the figure shows the state where the nail defined as the fixation member <b>61</b> is used for the fixation hole <b>10</b> of the upper side and where the screw defined as the fixation member <b>61</b> is used for the fixation hole <b>10</b> of the lower side. However, according to the building material of the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall, it is possible to use only one kind of the nail and the screw. In addition, after fixing the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side, the external material clamp A is moved to the lower direction from upside such that the upper engagement member <b>54</b> of the external material <b>50</b> is inserted into the space between the lower support plate <b>4</b> and the upstanding member <b>11</b>. In this manner, the lower support plate <b>4</b> is fixed by the engagement of the lower support plate <b>4</b> with the upper engagement member.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Then, the external material <b>50</b> of the upper side is moved to the lower direction from upside such that the lower engagement member <b>53</b> is inserted into the space between the upper support plate <b>3</b> and the upstanding member <b>11</b> under a condition where the cover member <b>51</b> is located in front of the upper support plate <b>3</b> and the lower support plate <b>4</b>. Consequently, the upper support plate <b>3</b> is engaged with the lower engagement member <b>53</b>. Then, the external material <b>50</b> is inserted with pressure to the lower direction so the lower surface of the cover member <b>51</b> comes into contact with the contact surface <b>52</b> of the external material in the lower side. In addition, the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side applies its load to the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side. In this manner, the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is mounted on the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side. Consequently, the cover member <b>51</b> conceals the lower support plate <b>4</b> in a position where the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is mounted on the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side. So, an entire of the external material clamp A is concealed by the external materials <b>50</b> so as not to be exposed to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition, in the external material clamp A, when the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is moved to the lower direction with pressure, the cover member <b>51</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side comes into contact with the contact surface <b>52</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side. In addition, at the same time or prior to the contact, the lower surface of the lower engagement member <b>53</b> of the external material in the upper side comes into contact with the receiving plate <b>5</b> (receiving support plate <b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When &#x201c;the cover member <b>51</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side comes into contact with the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the lower engagement member <b>53</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side comes into contact with the receiving plate <b>5</b>&#x201d;, simultaneously, the external material in the upper side is supported by both &#x201c;the contact surface <b>52</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b> of the external material clamp A&#x201d;. That is, the load of the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is shared by &#x201c;the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b>&#x201d;. Therefore, this configuration makes it possible to reduce the load applied to the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">However, in order to &#x201c;make a contact between the external materials <b>50</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;make a contact between the external material <b>50</b> and the receiving plate <b>5</b>&#x201d; simultaneously, there is a need to accurately design &#x201c;the size of the external material <b>50</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;the size of the external material clamp A&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the size for fixing the external material <b>50</b> with the external material clamp A&#x201d;. In addition, it is difficult to fix the external materials <b>50</b> to the wall with high accurate size.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In view of this, the external material clamp A preferably has the receiving plate <b>5</b> which is deformable in the vertical direction. With this configuration, the lower surface of the lower engagement member <b>53</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side comes into contact with the receiving plate <b>5</b>, firstly. Consequently, the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side moves the receiving plate to the lower direction with pressure. According to the movement with pressure, the receiving plate <b>5</b> is made deformation with flexure to the lower direction such that the contact position between the receiving plate <b>5</b> and the external material <b>50</b> is moved to the lower direction. The deformation is ended when the cover member <b>51</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side comes into contact with the contact surface <b>52</b> of the external material in the lower side. Therefore, the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is in contact with both &#x201c;the contact surface of the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b> of the external material clamp A&#x201d;. In addition, the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is supported by two contact portions. Consequently, the load of the external material in the upper side is shared by &#x201c;the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b>&#x201d;. This results in the reduction of the load applied to the external material in the lower side. Furthermore, in the embodiment of the figure, the receiving plate <b>5</b> is realized by the receiving support plate <b>6</b> of the upper support plate <b>3</b>. Therefore, the receiving support plate <b>6</b> with deformation is configured to provide the lower engagement member <b>53</b> of the external material <b>50</b> with the bias which pushes the lower engagement member <b>53</b> of the external material <b>50</b> to a rear surface side. Therefore, it is possible to fix the external material <b>50</b> with prevention of the backlash.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In addition, the receiving plate <b>5</b> is preferably formed to move into the lower end portion of the external material <b>50</b>. In this case, the lower surface of the lower engagement member <b>53</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side comes into contact with the receiving plate <b>5</b>, firstly. Then, the external material <b>50</b> moves to the lower direction with the pressure. Consequently, the receiving plate <b>5</b> is moved into the external material <b>50</b> from the lower surface of the lower engagement member <b>53</b> of the external material <b>50</b>. The movement into the external material <b>50</b> is ended when the cover member <b>51</b> of the external material in the upper side is in contact with the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side. Therefore, the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is in contact with both &#x201c;the contact surface <b>52</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b> of the external material clamp A&#x201d;. That is, the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is supported by the two contact portions of &#x201c;the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b> of the external material clamp A&#x201d;. The external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is supported by &#x201c;the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b>&#x201d; such that the load of the external material <b>50</b> is shared by &#x201c;the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b>&#x201d;. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the load applied to the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As explained above in each case, when the external material <b>50</b> has a fixed condition, the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is mounted in such a manner that &#x201c;the lower surface of the cover member <b>51</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side&#x201d; is in contact with &#x201c;the contact surface of the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d;. In addition, the lower surface of the lower engagement member <b>53</b> is in contact with the receiving plate <b>5</b>. Consequently, the load of the external material in the upper side is shared by &#x201c;the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving support plate <b>6</b> of the external material clamp A&#x201d;. Therefore, applying the excess load to the external material <b>50</b> is prevented. Therefore, this configuration makes it possible to prevent the breakage and the deformation of the external material.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is noted that the external material clamp A may be formed to have the member for receiving the external material <b>50</b> in an upper position of the horizontal plate. (The member for receiving the external material <b>50</b> is defined as the receiving stop member.) In this case, the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is not in contact with the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side. Therefore, the structure of supporting all the load of the external material <b>50</b> by the receiving stop member is established. However in this case, the surfaces of them are formed with the gap. Therefore, the appearance property is decreased. In addition, the external material <b>50</b> applies all of the loads to the external material clamp A via the receiving stop member. Therefore, the external material <b>50</b> is supported its load by the fixation member <b>61</b> which fixes the external material clamp A to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall. When all the loads of the external material <b>50</b> are applied to the external material clamp A, the fixation member <b>61</b> needs to support all the load directed to the lower direction. In this case, the external material clamp receives the load of the external material in each portion. Therefore, this configuration makes it possible to prevent the external material from being displaced.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">However, according to the external material clamping structure of the above, it is only need to support a part of the load of the external material <b>50</b> by the receiving plate <b>5</b>. In other words, the external material clamp A does not have to support all the loads of the external material. Therefore, it is possible to establish the fixation of the external material without a damage of the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall.</p>

That is, the receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b> has a cantilever structure which is coupled with the horizontal plate <b>2</b> in the lateral direction. A tip of the receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b> is formed to be located above the horizontal projection member <b>14</b>.

Therefore, the receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b> supports at least a part of the load of the external material <b>50</b>. Consequently, applying too much load to the external material in the lower side is prevented. Furthermore, preventing the breakage and the deformation of the external material <b>50</b> is made. Further, the receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b> is provided to the horizontal projection member <b>14</b>. Even if the receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b> receives the load, the horizontal projection member <b>14</b> acts as the rib to increase the strength of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. Therefore, the stress of the horizontal projection member <b>14</b> bears the load applied to the receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b>.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The receiving fix plate <b>8</b> is formed to have a boundary portion of the receiving fix plate <b>8</b> and the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The boundary of the receiving fix plate <b>8</b> and the fixed plate <b>1</b> is defined by a position above the boundary portion of the fixed plate <b>1</b> and the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The receiving fix plate <b>8</b> is formed by the cutting tip which is formed by cutting the horizontal plate <b>2</b> to its center in the longitudinal direction and which is cut out to extend in the lateral direction within the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The receiving fix plate <b>8</b> extends to the front direction such that the receiving fix plate <b>8</b> is approximately perpendicular to the fixed plate <b>1</b>. (The receiving fix plate <b>8</b> is approximately in parallel with the horizontal plate <b>2</b>.) That is, the receiving fix plate <b>8</b> has a cantilever structure which is coupled to the fixed plate <b>1</b> in the lateral direction. Therefore, the receiving fix plate <b>8</b> is located above the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. So, if the external material <b>50</b> is attached under a condition where the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is inserted its lower engagement member <b>53</b> into the space between the upstanding member <b>11</b> and the upper support plate <b>3</b>, the lower surface of the lower engagement member <b>53</b> is in contact with the receiving fix plate <b>8</b>.</p>

The fixing support plate <b>9</b> is formed by cutting out a part of the lower support plate <b>4</b>. Therefore, it is possible to easily form the fixing support plate without employing the separate components.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In addition, the fixing support plate <b>9</b> has a small width in the lateral direction. Therefore, the fixing support plate <b>9</b> is easily deformed in the front-back direction, compared with the case where the fixing plate <b>9</b> is formed by the lower support plate <b>4</b> entire of which is bent to project to the fixed plate <b>1</b>. So, the external material <b>50</b> is easily inserted into the space formed by the fixing support plate <b>9</b>. In addition, when the external material <b>50</b> is inserted thereto, the fixing support plate <b>9</b> surely clips the external material <b>50</b> with the elastic force. Consequently, the external material is surely fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In this embodiment, similar to the above embodiment, the external materials <b>50</b> are fixed such that the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is in contact with both &#x201c;the contact surface <b>52</b> of the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b> of the external material clamp A&#x201d;.

For example, it is possible to cut out a part of the projection side plate <b>13</b> of the upstanding member <b>11</b> to extend to the front direction. In this case, a part of the projection side plate <b>13</b> extends to the front direction is defined as the receiving plate <b>5</b>.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Summarizing the above, this invention discloses the external material clamp A which is used for fixing the upper-side external material <b>50</b> and the lower-side external material <b>50</b> arranged in the vertical direction of the wall of the building wall to fix the upper-side external material <b>50</b> and the lower-side external material <b>50</b> to the wall of the building. The external material clamp A has a vertical direction along the vertical direction of the wall, a lateral direction along a lateral direction of the wall, and a front-back direction perpendicular to the wall. The external material A comprises the fixed plate <b>1</b>, the horizontal plate <b>2</b>, the upper support plate <b>3</b>, and the lower support plate <b>4</b>.

The upper support plate <b>3</b> is formed to project to the upper direction from the front end of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The upper support plate <b>3</b> is configured to engage with the lower end portion of the upper-side external material <b>50</b> which is arranged in the upper side to support the upper-side external material <b>50</b>.

That is, the load of the external material <b>50</b> in the upper side is shared by &#x201c;the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side&#x201d; and &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b> of the external material clamp A&#x201d;. Therefore, applying the excess load to the external material <b>50</b> in the lower side is prevented. In addition, the receiving plate <b>5</b> receives a part of the load of the external material in the upper side. Therefore, there is no possibility that the excess load is applied to only the receiving plate <b>5</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the breakage of the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall. So, it is possible to reduce the load applied to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall as well as to prevent the excess load from being applied to the external material <b>50</b>.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In particular, the fixing support plate <b>9</b> comprises the clipping plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>and the clipping tip <b>9</b><i>b</i>. The clipping plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>extends to back-lower direction from the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The clipping tip <b>9</b><i>b </i>extends to the front-lower direction from the lower end of the clipping plate <b>9</b><i>a</i>. Consequently, the lower support plate <b>4</b> has the first cross section which is perpendicular to the lateral direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The first cross section has a V-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In this case, the fixing support plate <b>9</b> comes into elastic contact with the upper end of the front surface of the lower-side external material <b>50</b> attached in the lower side. Therefore, the fixing support plate <b>9</b> is in cooperation with fixed plate <b>1</b> to hold the lower-side external material <b>50</b> therebetween. Therefore, it is possible to produce the external material clamp which is configured to support the external material with prevention of the backlash of the external material.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Further, the lower support plate <b>4</b> has a pair of the lower support plates <b>15</b>. The lower support plates <b>15</b> are arranged in the lateral direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixing support plate <b>9</b> is located between the lower support plates <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In this case, the fixing support plate <b>9</b> has a width in the lateral direction. Therefore, compared with a case where an entire of the lower support plate <b>4</b> is bent to project to the fixed plate <b>1</b>, it is possible to easily deform the lower support plate <b>4</b> in the front-back direction. As a result, it is possible to easily insert the external material <b>50</b> into the space formed by the fixing support plate <b>9</b>. Further, it is possible to clip and hold the external material <b>50</b> with the elastic force.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Furthermore, as shown in each figure, the external material clamp A comprises the fixation rib <b>21</b>. The fixation rib <b>21</b> is provided to the upper end portion of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixation rib <b>21</b> is formed over the lateral direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixation rib <b>21</b> is a plate which is bent such that the fixation rib <b>21</b> is projected to the front direction.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In this case, it is possible to enhance the strength of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. In particular, even if the horizontal plate <b>2</b> receives the load, it is possible to prevent the fixed plate <b>1</b> from being bent by the load applied to the horizontal plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Furthermore, the fixation rib <b>21</b> has a lower-inclination plate and an upper-inclination plate. The lower inclination plate extends to the front-upper direction from the upper end of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The upper-inclination plate extends to the back-upper direction from the upper end of the lower-inclination plate. Consequently, the fixation rib <b>21</b> has a second cross section which is perpendicular to the lateral direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The second cross section is formed to have an L-shape. The upper-inclination plate is provided with the fixation hole. The fixation hole penetrates from the rear surface to the front surface of the upper-inclination plate.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In this case, fixation rib <b>21</b> having a high strength is formed with the fixation hole. Therefore, even if the external material clamp comprises the fixation hole, the external material clamp maintains the high strength.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Furthermore, the external material clamp A further comprises the fixation rib <b>22</b>. The fixation rib <b>22</b> is provided to the lower end portion of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixation rib <b>22</b> is formed over the lateral direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixation rib <b>22</b> is realized by the plate which is bent such that the fixation rib <b>22</b> projects to the front direction.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Also in this case, it is possible to enhance the strength of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. In particular, even if the load is applied to the horizontal plate <b>2</b>, the high strength of the fixed plate <b>1</b> makes it possible to prevent the bending of the fixed plate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In addition, the upper support plate <b>3</b> is formed in both lateral ends of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In this case, the horizontal plate <b>2</b> holds the upper-side external material <b>50</b> with stability. Therefore, the lower end of the upper-side external material <b>50</b> is prohibited to move to the front direction.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In addition, each the upper support plate <b>3</b> extends to the front-upper direction from the front end of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In this case, the horizontal plate stably holds the upper-side external material. Therefore, the lower end of the upper-side external material <b>50</b> is prohibited to move to the front direction.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In addition, the lower support plate <b>4</b> comprises the main plate <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the sub plate <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The sub plate <b>4</b><i>b </i>extends to the front-upper direction from the front end of the center in the lateral direction of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>. The main plate <b>4</b><i>a </i>extends to the lower direction from the front end of the sub plate <b>4</b><i>b</i>. Consequently, the lower support plate <b>4</b> is cooperative with the front end of the horizontal plate <b>2</b> to form the lower support rib <b>25</b>. The lower support rib <b>25</b> is formed over a lateral direction of the fixed plate. The lower support rib <b>25</b> has a third cross section which is perpendicular to the lateral direction of the fixed plate. The third cross section is formed to have an L-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In this case, the lower support plate <b>4</b> is enhanced its strength.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In addition, the horizontal plate <b>2</b> has a first length along a thickness direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The fixed plate <b>1</b> is provided at its both lateral ends with projection members <b>11</b>. Each the projection member extends in the vertical direction. Each the projection member has a second length along the thickness direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The second length is set to be shorter than the first length.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In this case, the upper support plate <b>3</b> and the upstanding member <b>11</b> surely support the upper-side external material <b>50</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Furthermore, each the upstanding member <b>11</b> comprises the projection-front plate <b>12</b> and the projection-side plate <b>13</b>. The projection-front plate <b>12</b> extends to the front direction from the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The projection-side plate <b>13</b> extends to the lateral direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b> from the front end of the projection-front plate <b>12</b>. The upstanding member <b>11</b> is provided at its upper end portion with the smoothly-curved surface. Consequently, &#x201c;the fixed plate <b>1</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;the projection-front plate <b>12</b>&#x201d;, and &#x201c;projection-side plate <b>13</b>&#x201d; are connected smoothly. Furthermore, the upstanding member <b>11</b> is provided at its lower end portion with the smoothly-curved surface. Consequently, &#x201c;the fixed plate <b>1</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;the projection-front plate <b>12</b>&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the projection-side plate <b>13</b>&#x201d; are connected smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Consequently, the upper-side external material <b>50</b> is smoothly attached to the external material clamp <b>1</b> along the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall. Similarly, the lower-side external material <b>50</b> is smoothly attached to the external material clamp <b>1</b> along the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In addition, the horizontal plate <b>2</b> is provided with the horizontal projection member <b>14</b>. The horizontal projection member <b>14</b> is formed to project to the upper direction. The horizontal projection member <b>14</b> has the upper surface which is flat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In addition, the horizontal projection member <b>14</b> is located in the center of the lateral direction of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In this case, the horizontal plate is enhanced its strength.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In addition, the horizontal projection member <b>14</b> further comprises the receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b>. The receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b> extends to the front-upper direction from the horizontal projection member <b>14</b>. The receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b> defines the receiving plate <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the horizontal projection member <b>14</b> is formed with a slit <b>14</b><i>a </i>having a U-shape. The slit <b>14</b><i>a </i>has a U-shaped cross section in a plane perpendicular to the thickness direction of the fixed plate <b>1</b>. The receiving horizontal plate <b>1</b> is defined by the area of an inside of the slit <b>14</b><i>a </i>having the U-shape. The receiving horizontal plate <b>7</b> extends to the front-upper direction to the horizontal projection member <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In this case, there is no need to perform the complex work which is required when the receiving plate <b>5</b> is formed by the separate components. So, it is possible to easily form the receiving plate <b>5</b>. Furthermore, in the upper-side external material <b>50</b> comes into contact with the lower-side external material <b>50</b>, applying the large load to both the upper-side external material <b>50</b> and the lower-side external material <b>50</b> is prevented. In addition, the horizontal plate <b>2</b> is enhanced its strength by the horizontal projection member <b>14</b>. Therefore, even if the receiving plate <b>5</b> receives the large load, it is possible to prevent the breakage of the horizontal plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In addition, it is preferred to employ the external material clamping structure which uses the external material clamp A to fix the external materials <b>50</b> to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall of the building. The external material clamp A has the fixed plate <b>1</b> which is mounted on and fixed to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall. The lower-side external material <b>50</b> attached to the lower side of the external material clamp A is engaged at its upper end with the lower support plate <b>4</b>, whereby the lower-side external material <b>50</b> is supported. The upper-side external material <b>50</b> attached to the upper side of the external material clamp A is engaged at its lower end portion with the upper support plate <b>3</b>, whereby the upper-side external material <b>50</b> is supported. In addition, the upper-side external material is in contact with the lower-side external material <b>50</b> attached in the lower side. The load of the upper-side external material is fixed such that the upper-side external material is mounted to both &#x201c;the receiving plate <b>5</b>&#x201d; and the lower-side external material <b>50</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In this case, it is possible to reduce the load applied to the foundation <b>60</b> of the wall, whereby applying the excess load to the external material <b>50</b> is prevented. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the breakage and the deformation of the external material <b>50</b>.</p>
