<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The application relates generally to gas turbine engines and, more particularly, to mounting engine nacelle components to aircrafts.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">For safety reasons, aircraft engine powerplants are designed to extremely high standards, and to accommodate even rare situations such as bird strikes or the loss of a blade from one of the high-velocity rotary components such as the fan or compressor (often referred to as a blade-off). In the case of turbofans, the nacelle is often provided in the form of two halves which are hingedly connected at the pylon in a manner to be openable to access the engine therein. The hinges are designed to support the nacelle when it is open for maintenance, the expected mechanical stress during normal engine operation when they are closed, and the mechanical stress which can occur during extreme events. In the past, strengthening the hinges was a way that the loads resulting from an extreme event have been addressed, which inevitably leads to increased weight. Accordingly, there remains room for improvement.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a turbofan gas turbine engine <b>10</b> of a type preferably provided for use in subsonic flight, generally comprising in serial flow communication a fan <b>12</b> through which ambient air is propelled, a multistage compressor <b>14</b> for pressurizing the air, a combustor <b>16</b> in which the compressed air is mixed with fuel and ignited for generating an annular stream of hot combustion gases, and a turbine section <b>18</b> for extracting energy from the combustion gases.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turbofan gas turbine engines have an engine structure <b>20</b> by which the rotary shafts <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are held in respective positions relative the non-rotary components such as stators and casings, and which also holds the non-rotary components in proper positions relative to one another. The engine structure <b>20</b> is engineered to withstand all forces which can be expected during operation of the engine. The turbofan gas turbine engine <b>10</b> is held in a position relative to a wing of the aircraft via a pylon <b>26</b>. The engine structure <b>20</b> is secured to the pylon <b>26</b>, and more specifically to a structure <b>28</b> of the pylon rather than an aerodynamic skin or the like, via a primary support structure <b>30</b> which can include a plurality of main mounts <b>32</b>, as known by persons of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The nacelle is provided in the form of two halves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, one on each side of a central vertical plane <b>40</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. These halves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are often referred to in the art as D-ducts, C-ducts, Fan-duct halves, or Thrust reverser doors when the nacelle includes a thrust reverser, to name a few examples. Each half is hingedly connected to both the pylon and the engine structure via a corresponding hinged connection <b>42</b>. More specifically, the halves <b>38</b>, <b>36</b> are hingedly mounted to a corresponding side of the pylon <b>26</b>, in order to be openable upwardly to allow accessing the engine core <b>44</b> of the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> for maintenance and the like. The halves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are pivoted downwardly to prepare the engine for use, where they can engage a portion of the engine structure for support, often with mating V-grooves or the like such as illustrated. In this example, the two halves are latched to one another with the engaging portion of the engine structure trapped therebetween during use, thus effectively lockingly engaging the free end of the halves with the engine structure during use.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The hinged connections <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> can include a plurality of pairs of hinge units <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> aligned with one another along a corresponding pair of hinge axes <b>50</b>, each hinge axis being oriented generally along the length of the engine and pylon <b>26</b>. Each hinge unit <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> can include a pylon hinge member <b>52</b> pivotally engaged with a nacelle hinge member <b>54</b> for relative pivoting. An example configuration including both a rear pair of hinge units and a forward pair of hinge units is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternate examples can have three, four, or more pairs of hinge units depending on the specificities of the application and designer choice.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Collectively, the hinged units are designed to support the weight of a corresponding to a nacelle half when the half is in the open configuration or moved between the open and closed configurations. During operation of the gas turbine engine <b>10</b>, the hinged connections <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> are also used, in combination with the engine structure <b>20</b> trapped between the free ends of the nacelle halves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, to hold the halves <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> in position relative to each other and relative to the engine core <b>44</b>. Accordingly, at least two of the pairs of hinge units <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are typically designed with a snug engagement between their hinge members <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. In some embodiments, particularly in cases with more than two pairs of hinge units, one or more of the pairs of hinges can be designed to remain loosely engaged during operation of the gas turbine engine, with one or more others of the pairs of hinges maintaining the relative position of the nacelle halves more tightly.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The design process of gas turbine engines is typically assisted by computer-assisted simulation. Computer-assisted simulation can be used to simulate an extreme operating condition such as a fan blade-off scenario. Such stresses tend to occur particularly in the hinge pair or hinge pairs closest to the blade-off location. Using the pairs of hinges to withstand the extreme stresses which can occur during a fan blade-off scenario can allow to avoid using an additional structure to do so. However, designing the pairs of hinges to withstand such extreme stresses typically led to oversizing the pairs of hinges, which led to added weight as a trade-off. In computer-assisted simulation, the totality of connections between the gas turbine engine (including the nacelle) and the pylon are a statically non-determined set, the analytically calculated blade-off hinge loads are used as sizing loads in the design of the nacelle and the pylon structure and therefore the weight of these structures increases with the said hinge loads, which can form a vicious circle attracting even greater loads in the hinges.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">By contrast, the mounting structure described herein uses a flexible connection which can allow flexibility between the hinge units of at least one of the hinge unit pairs and the primary support structure of the engine. The flexible connection can be used at the pair of hinges closest to the fan, or otherwise determined to be most likely affected in an extreme scenario for instance, and optionally used at more than one hinge unit pair. This elasticity can be either permanent, or released only after a certain hinge load is exceeded which can be achieved by using a stiffer fuse attachment which collapses (e.g. shears) at a certain design load (structurally fused connection).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The flexible connection can be clearly defined by contrast with the primary support structure which connects the engine structure to the pylon. More specifically, understanding that the flexible connection is designed to allow a pair of hinge units, to accommodate for extreme forces exerted on the nacelle in the transversal plane, a satisfactory flexibility can be defined to correspond to allowing a yielding displacement five times greater of either one of the associated mating hinge members than the corresponding movement of the engine structure for a same extreme force in the transversal plane. Such an amount of displacement can be considered to effectively &#x2018;decouple&#x2019; the stress at the hinge from the stress in the engine structure in the context described above.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of a flexible connection <b>60</b>. More specifically, in this example, the flexible connection <b>60</b> is provided for the given pair of hinge units <b>48</b> axially closest to the fan <b>12</b>. The pylon hinge members <b>52</b> are provided at two opposite ends of a transverse beam <b>62</b>. The transverse beam <b>62</b> is mounted to a flexible floor <b>64</b> of the pylon <b>26</b>, which, in turn, is mounted to a structure <b>66</b> of the pylon <b>26</b>, rather than being mounted directly to the structure <b>66</b> of the pylon <b>26</b>, forming a flexible connection <b>60</b>. More specifically, referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the floor <b>64</b> of the pylon <b>26</b> in this embodiment is made from sheet metal having a relatively thin gauge. The metal sheets are upturned to form flanges <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> which are fastened in abutment against the front and back face of an upward-protruding portion <b>72</b> of the transverse beam <b>62</b>. The fasteners <b>74</b> are positioned a certain distance upwardly from the pylon floor <b>64</b>. Accordingly, each transversal side of the upward-protruding portion <b>72</b> of the transverse beam <b>62</b> can be moved upwardly or downwardly as the corresponding portion of the floor elastically yields to a corresponding upward or downward force exerted on a corresponding one of the halves and transferred to the flexible connection via a corresponding hinge unit, leading to movement of the corresponding hinge unit. In this embodiment, since both sides of the flexible connection <b>60</b> allow both upward and downward liberty of movement, torsion stress around an axis parallel to the main axis <b>11</b> of the engine can also be accomodated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A simplified sketch of the approach illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> is illustrated at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows a variant where rather than being conferred only by the flexibility of the pylon floor, flexibility is also conferred by way of flexible members provided in the form of spring-shaped flexible brackets. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> shows another variant where flexibility is also conferred by way of flexible members made of an elastomeric material and interposed between the transverse beam and the pylon floor.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be understood that using the teachings of this disclosure, the flexibility can be specifically tailored in view of specific embodiments, or according to results of computer assisted simulation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a simplified sketch of still another variant where the flexible connection is provided in the form of a plurality of linkages provided between a transverse beam and the pylon structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows a simplified sketch of still another variant, also using linkages, but where the linkages are arranged according to a Watts linkage. It will be understood that more than one means of providing a flexible connection can be combined in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows a simplified sketch illustrating an embodiment where the flexible connection is provided in the form of two flexible members <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> provided between the pylon structure <b>66</b> and a transverse beam connecting the halves. The flexible members <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> can be springs, elastomers, the floor of the pylon as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, or linkages such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> or <b>7</b>B to name a few examples. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, flexible members <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> are also used, however they are configured to provide independent flexibility to each one of the hinge units of the hinge unit pair, with each flexible member being provided between a corresponding one of the halves and the pylon primary connection.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an example of a fused connection embodiment in which halves <b>136</b> are hingedly connected at opposite ends of a transverse beam <b>162</b> which, itself, is received in a pylon primary connection <b>166</b>. The transverse beam <b>162</b> is typically rigidly prevented, by shear pins <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>, from sliding transversally in the pylon primary connection <b>166</b> upon application of a tangential force F applied to the half. The shear pins act as a fused connection between the transverse beam <b>162</b> and the pylon primary connection <b>166</b>. If the force F exceeds a predetermined threshold, the shear pins break and the rigid connection by the shear pins <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> is converted into a flexible connection provided by way of resilient elements <b>178</b>, <b>180</b> such as elastomers or springs, allowing the transverse beam to slide transversally in the pylon primary connection <b>166</b> to a certain extent determined by the resilience of the resilient elements <b>178</b>, <b>180</b>. The flexible connection allows a distance of displacement which is at least five times that of a similar force acting in a similar direction at the closest engine mount.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The above description is meant to be exemplary only, and one skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made to the embodiments described without departing from the scope of the invention disclosed. For example, nacelle halves can have other functions than simply directing a bypass flow (e.g. reverse flow, inlet), and the flexible connection can be applied to many suitable forms of nacelle halves. Also, a flexible connection can be provided to only one, some, or all of the hinge units&#x2014;for instance, in an embodiment having four hinge units forming each hinged connection, the hinge units of two of the hinge unit pairs can be floating during use of the aircraft, with the hinge units of only one or both of the remaining hinge unit pairs being provided with a flexible connection. Still other modifications which fall within the scope of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art, in light of a review of this disclosure, and such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
