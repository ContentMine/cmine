<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A winding machine includes an upper winding roller and a separation mechanism arranged at a location close to and below the upper winding roller. The separation mechanism includes a pivot shaft having an outer circumferential surface and at least one pinch arm having a connecting end coupled to the outer circumferential surface of the pivot shaft and a web engagement end extending outward from the outer circumferential surface of the pivot shaft. When the pinch arm is driven by a driving mechanism to rotate the web engagement end of the pinch arm to an engagement position where the web engagement end opposes the upper winding roller, the web engagement end of the pinch arm sucks and holds or guides a web material passing therethrough, whereby the web material is subjected to a pulling force induced by a roll of paper formed in a winding nip to tear and thus separate.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to tearing and thus separating a web material, and in particular to a method and a structure for separating the web material in a winding machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional winding machine comprises an upper winding roller, a guide plate, a lower winding roller, and a rider roller. The guide plate is arranged at a location close to and below a circumferential surface of the upper winding roller and forms a channel with the upper winding roller. The upper winding roller, the lower winding roller, and the rider roller form therebetween a winding nip.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A core around which a web material is wound to form a roll of paper is fed by a conveyor to a location beside the upper winding roller and is then pushed by a core inserter into a passage delimited by the guide plate to reach the winding nip where the web material is wound around the core to form the roll of paper, such as a roll of toilet tissue. After completion of the winding operation of a roll of paper, a rotatable arm is controlled to have a speed that is faster or slower than the rotational speed of the upper winding roller in order to induce a speed difference by which the web material is torn and thus separated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another known technique uses a method and a structure that realizes separation of web material with physical engagement. For example, a driving arm is positioned against a surface of an upper winding roller arranged in a winding machine to hold down a web material passing through the surface of the upper winding roller. The web material is then torn and thus separated by a pulling force induced by a roll of paper that is formed in a winding nip by wounding the paper around a core.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the above discussed conventional winding machine, care must be taken for the rotatable arm to rotate at a speed not equal to that of an upper winding roller in order to pull apart the web material through a difference in speed. In case the web material is made of a tough material, the speed difference between the rotatable arm and the upper winding roller must be sufficiently large, otherwise the web material would not be pulled apart by the speed difference.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the known web material separation technique that employs physical engagement, the driving arm must be positioned to physically contact the surface of the upper winding roller. This causes certain concerns about the durability and operation safety of the components and parts of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, an objective of the present invention is to provide a winding machine comprising a separation mechanism that tears up and separates a web material with a non-physical-engagement type operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a winding machine that comprises an evacuation device and a separation mechanism comprising a suction channel and a passage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further objective of the present invention is to provide a method and a device for separating the web material in a winding machine that employ a vacuum suction force to separate the web material.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The solution adopted in the present invention to overcome the problems of the conventional techniques comprises a winding machine that comprises an upper winding roller and a separation mechanism arranged at a location close to and below a circumferential surface of the upper winding roller. The separation mechanism comprises a pivot shaft having an outer circumferential surface and at least one pinch arm having a connecting end and a web engagement end. The connecting end is coupled to the outer circumferential surface of the pivot shaft. The web engagement end extends outward from the outer circumferential surface of the pivot shaft. When the pinch arm is driven by a driving mechanism to rotate the web engagement end of the pinch arm to an engagement position where the web engagement end opposes the upper winding roller, the web engagement end of the pinch arm sucks and holds or guides a web material passing therethrough, whereby the web material is subjected to a pulling force induced by a roll of paper formed in a winding nip to tear and thus separate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the solution provided by the present invention, the pinch arm is allowed to tear a web material fed through a winding machine without physical contact with an upper winding roller of the machine. Thus, smoothness and safety of the operation of the winding machine are enhanced and mechanical durability of the components and parts of the winding machine is improved.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to the drawings and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a winding machine constructed in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, broadly designated at <b>100</b>, comprises a machine frame <b>11</b>, an upper winding roller <b>12</b>, a plurality of guide plates <b>13</b> (only one being visible in a schematic side elevational view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a separation mechanism <b>14</b>, a lower winding roller <b>15</b>, a rider roller <b>16</b>, a core conveyor <b>17</b>, a pair of feed rollers <b>21</b>, a perforation device <b>22</b>, an inclined chute <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The guide plates <b>13</b> are located at positions near and below the upper winding roller <b>12</b> such that a channel <b>3</b> is formed between the guide plates <b>13</b> and the upper winding roller <b>12</b>. A winding nip <b>19</b> is formed between the upper winding roller <b>12</b>, the lower winding roller <b>15</b>, and the rider roller <b>16</b>. A long tape of web material <b>4</b> that has a predetermined thickness and width is fed along a feeding direction I<b>1</b> by the feed rollers <b>21</b> to pass through the perforation device <b>22</b> that forms a line of perforations <b>41</b> that extends in a direction substantially normal to the feeding direction I<b>1</b> at a fixed interval (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The web material tape is then moved to bear against a lower circumferential surface of the upper winding roller <b>12</b> and wound around a first core <b>5</b> at the winding nip <b>19</b> to thereby form a roll of paper <b>51</b> having a predetermined diameter, such as a roll of toilet paper.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the separation device <b>14</b> is arranged near and below the upper winding roller <b>12</b>. The separation device <b>14</b> comprises a pivot shaft <b>141</b> and at least one pinch arm <b>142</b>. The pivot shaft <b>14</b> comprises an outer circumferential surface <b>141</b><i>a </i>and the pinch arm <b>142</b> is coupled to the outer circumferential surface <b>141</b><i>a </i>of the pivot shaft <b>141</b>. Each pinch arm <b>142</b> has a connecting end <b>142</b><i>a </i>and a web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b</i>. The connecting end <b>142</b><i>a </i>is fixedly mounted to the outer circumferential surface <b>141</b><i>a </i>of the pivot shaft <b>141</b>, and the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>extends outward from the outer circumferential surface <b>141</b><i>a </i>of the pivot shaft <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A driving mechanism (not shown) drives the pinch arm <b>142</b> to rotate about the pivot shaft <b>141</b>. The pinch arm <b>142</b> is rotatable in a rotation direction I<b>3</b> that is opposite to a rotation direction I<b>2</b> of the upper winding roller <b>12</b> so that the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> is rotated to be selectively set on an engagement position A or off the engagement position A. The rotation of the pinch arm <b>142</b> defines a circular rotation locus <b>142</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> forms a suction opening <b>142</b><i>c</i>. The pivot shaft <b>141</b> is a hollow tube forming internally a suction channel <b>141</b><i>b</i>. The pivot shaft <b>141</b> forms a plurality of apertures <b>141</b><i>c </i>in the outer circumferential surface <b>141</b><i>a </i>at predetermined positions to communicate the suction channel <b>141</b><i>b</i>. The pinch arm <b>142</b> forms internally at least one passage <b>142</b><i>e </i>communicating the suction opening <b>142</b><i>c </i>and the aperture <b>141</b><i>c </i>of the pivot shaft <b>141</b>. An evacuation device (not shown) is connected to the pivot shaft <b>141</b> to remove air from the suction channel <b>141</b><i>b </i>of the pivot shaft <b>141</b> and the passage <b>142</b><i>e </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b>, so that the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> may establish a vacuum suction force at the suction opening <b>142</b><i>c</i>. Preferably, the suction opening <b>142</b><i>c </i>of the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>shows a recessed structure so that an excellent suction effect can be realized by the suction opening <b>142</b><i>c </i>to attract and hold the web material <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-12</figref>, a sequence of operations are performed by the winding machine according to the first embodiment of the present invention to tear and thus separate the web material. When the pinch arm <b>142</b> is driven to rotate along the rotation direction I<b>3</b>, the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> is periodically rotated to reach the engagement position A where the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> opposes the upper winding roller <b>12</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). At this moment, the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> is put into engagement with the web material <b>4</b>, but maintains a predetermined spacing from the upper winding roller <b>12</b> and is thus not in physical engagement with the upper winding roller <b>12</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). The web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> sucks and holds the web material <b>4</b> on the suction opening <b>142</b><i>c </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A second core <b>6</b> is carried forward by one of a number of carriers <b>171</b> of the core conveyor <b>17</b> to a loading nip of the channel <b>3</b> formed between the guide plates <b>13</b> and the upper winding roller <b>12</b>. Afterwards, a core inserter <b>172</b> of the core conveyor <b>17</b> is automatically turned to push the second core <b>6</b> into the channel <b>3</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, to allow the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> to properly attract and hold the web material <b>4</b> passing through the channel <b>3</b>, the rotational speed of the lower winding roller <b>15</b> is controlled by a controller (not shown) to reduce and get slightly slowed down at the time when the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> reaches the engagement position A, whereby the web material <b>4</b> gets partially slackened and hangs down (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to allow the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> to properly attract and hold the web material <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the web material <b>4</b> is sucked and held by the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b>, the paper roll <b>51</b> that is formed by being rolled up in the winding nip <b>19</b> applies a pulling force to a right-hand side portion of the web material <b>4</b> so as to tear the web material <b>4</b>, whereby the web material <b>4</b> that is so torn forms, at the location where the tearing occurs, a trailing edge <b>43</b> in connection with the first core <b>5</b> and a leading edge <b>44</b> in connection with the second core <b>6</b>. The trailing edge <b>43</b> of the web material <b>4</b> keeps moving to and is then wound around the first core <b>5</b> to complete the winding operation of the paper roll <b>51</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). At this point, the lower winding roller <b>15</b> resumes the original rotational speed. The location where the web material <b>4</b> is torn is between the engagement position A and the paper roll <b>51</b> of the first core <b>5</b>. In a practical application, the location where the web material <b>4</b> tears is at the portion of the web material <b>4</b> where the perforations <b>41</b> are formed by the perforation device <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the web material <b>4</b> is torn, the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> sucks and holds the leading edge <b>44</b> of the web material <b>4</b> and the pinch arm <b>142</b> is caused to rotate in an opposite direction to bring the leading edge <b>44</b> of the web material <b>4</b> to the second core <b>6</b> that is just fed into the channel <b>3</b>, to allow the leading edge <b>44</b> of the web material <b>4</b> to be primarily wound around an outer circumferential surface of the second core <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the pinch arm <b>142</b> is rotated to such an extent to get away from the web material <b>4</b> and the channel <b>3</b>, the second core <b>6</b> keeps rolling forward along the channel <b>3</b>, and the leading edge <b>44</b> of the web material <b>4</b> is completely wound around the second core <b>6</b>. Meanwhile, the trailing edge <b>43</b> of the web material <b>4</b> is attached to the paper roll <b>51</b> to complete the winding operation of the roll paper <b>51</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the second core <b>6</b> is transferred to the winding nip <b>19</b> due to an effect of speed difference between the upper winding roller <b>12</b> and the lower winding roller <b>15</b> caused by speed reduction of the lower winding roller <b>15</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) and the winding operation of a new roll of paper starts. Meanwhile, the completed paper roll <b>51</b> is discharged by moving along the inclined chute <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the paper roll <b>51</b> is being discharged, the rider roller <b>16</b> that is connected to a oscillable gripping arm <b>161</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) having a pivot shaft <b>162</b> about which the oscillable gripping arm <b>161</b> reciprocally rotates is allowed to do reciprocal rotation about the pivot shaft <b>162</b>, whereby the rider roller <b>16</b> that is connected to the oscillable gripping arm <b>161</b> is moved upward and downward, following the reciprocation path of the oscillable gripping arm <b>161</b>. Thus, when the paper roll <b>51</b> has been discharged, the rider roller <b>16</b> that initially presses against the paper roll <b>51</b> moves downward to press against the second core <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-20</figref>, a sequence of operations of a winding machine in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention are illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> illustrate the same operations as those shown in the first embodiment, but in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, in the normal winding operation of the web material, the rotational speed of the lower winding roller <b>15</b> is slightly reduced and thus slowed down to have the web material <b>4</b> slackened inside the channel <b>3</b> and thus forming a slack portion <b>42</b>. The slack portion <b>42</b> is guided by the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) to have at least a portion thereof (that is adjacent to the second core <b>6</b>) clamped between the second core <b>6</b> and the guide plates <b>13</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). At this point, the lower winding roller <b>15</b> resumes the original rotational speed and a pulling force is applied from the paper roll <b>51</b> formed in the winding nip <b>19</b> to the web material <b>4</b> to tear the web material <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). The location where the tearing of the web material <b>4</b> occurs is between the location where the web material <b>4</b> is clamped between the second core <b>6</b> and the guide plates <b>13</b> and the paper roll <b>51</b> of the first core <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Similar to the previous embodiment, when the pinch arm <b>142</b> is driven to rotate in the rotation direction I<b>3</b> to bring the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> to periodically reach the engagement position A where the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>opposes the upper winding roller <b>12</b>, the suction opening <b>142</b><i>c </i>of the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> generates a suction force, which helps the web engagement end <b>142</b><i>b </i>of the pinch arm <b>142</b> to clamp at least a portion of the slack portion <b>42</b> of the web material <b>4</b> between the second core <b>6</b> and the guide plates <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the web material <b>4</b> is torn, the subsequent operations (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) are identical to those of the previous embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof and the best modes for carrying out the present invention, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that a variety of modifications and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention which is intended to be defined by the appended claims.</p>

<claim-text>3. A structure for separating a web material in a winding machine, which comprises an upper winding roller, at least one guide plate, a lower winding roller, and a rider roller, wherein the guide plate is arranged at a location close to and below the upper winding roller and forms a channel with the upper winding roller, the upper winding roller, the lower winding roller, and the rider roller forming therebetween a winding nip, a web material being fed into and passing through the channel to form a paper roll in the winding nip by being wound around a first core, a separation mechanism being arranged at a location close to and below the upper winding roller, the separation mechanism comprising:
<claim-text>a pivot shaft, which has an outer circumferential surface;</claim-text>
<claim-text>at least one pinch arm, which is coupled to the outer circumferential surface of the pivot shaft, the pinch arm being rotatable in a direction opposite to a predetermined rotation direction of the upper winding roller, the pinch arm having a connecting end and a web engagement end, the connecting end being fixedly mounted to the outer circumferential surface of the pivot shaft, the web engagement end extending outward from the outer circumferential surface of the pivot shaft; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>a driving mechanism, which is connected to the pivot shaft to drive the pinch arm to rotate about the pivot shaft so as to have the web engagement end of the pinch arm periodically set on an engagement position or off the engagement position, the web engagement end of the pinch arm being engageable with the web material while maintaining a predetermined spacing from the upper winding roller when at the engagement position, such that the pinch arm does not contact the upper winding roller;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the lower winding roller is reduced in rotational speed relative to the upper winding roller to slacken the web material within the channel and thereby form a slack portion; and,</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein, when the pinch arm is driven by the driving mechanism to have the web engagement end of the pinch arm reaching the engagement position, the web engagement end of the pinch arm conveys a vacuum suction force to guide at least one portion of the slack portion of the web material such that the at least one portion is clamped between a second core and the guide plate, whereby the web material is subjected to a pulling force induced by the paper roll formed in the winding nip to tear and thus separate at a location between the location where the at least one portion is clamped between the second core and the guide plate and the paper roll of the first core.</claim-text>
